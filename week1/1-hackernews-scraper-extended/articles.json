We&#x27;ve gone through the research, we&#x27;ve met thousands of members in person and coordinated thousands of dates, and we&#x27;ve learned how to greatly improve the odds when it comes to personal introductions.

They were such a horrifying GPIO interface, and yet their presence meant that every open project used them by default, and if they didn&#x27;t then they used high priced tools instead.  Now that parallel ports are dead, we have an abundance of affordable USB GPIO devices to choose from, from Arduinos to FTDI devices (and many others of course).  And best of all, numerous devices can be connected at once via a cheap USB hub, unlike parallel port devices.",

It may synchronize with multiple sources: WebSocket to the server, WebStorage to the cache, WebRTC to a peer -- all at the same time.\nThat flexibility is paid by (1) implementing Lamport timestamps and by (2) limited use of version vectors (on handshake). ShareJS versions are linear, for example, but those linear versions are specific to a replica, as far as I can tell. In OT, version 3 here and version 3 there are possibly different.\nCRDT&#x2F;CT is generally easier to reason about than OT, esp. considering various non-standards situations and implications. That is mostly because CRDT (this flavor) employs &quot;partially ordered log of immutable operations&quot; while OT operations are mutable. That is the formal difference.",

        "text": "It would definitely be interesting to do that! I had originally started out wanting to do something as natural as possible, but got myself into all sorts of frustrating trouble with ants getting turned around or wandering off forever. I&#x27;m fairly sure these were just failures in implementation, but they forced me towards looking at slightly more artificial designs.<p>The Ruby-based simulator discussed in this article used Rich Hickey&#x27;s Clojure ant simulator as a starting point:\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/spacemanaki/1093917\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;spacemanaki&#x2F;1093917</a><p>This simulator was perhaps a bit closer to what you are looking for. It only emits one type of pheremone, which it releases on a continuous basis. However, it maintains a relative sense of position of where &quot;home&quot; is, which make it possible to prevent ants from &quot;flipping around&quot; within a pheromone trail.<p>In my simulation, I wanted to make it so the ants didn&#x27;t need to know where there home was, allowing them to rely purely following the gradient of the pheromone trails. To do this, I introduced two types of pheremones: one emitted when food was found, and another emitted when the home was found.<p>In retrospect, I possibly could have continuously emitted the &quot;food&quot; pheremone when traveling outbound, and the &quot;home&quot; pheremone when traveling inbound. I can&#x27;t remember if I tried that and ran into trouble, or just didn&#x27;t think of the idea at the time I was building this.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that though the behavior of the world is very artificial (the whole trail gets marked at once after a complete path is run), the behavior of the ants themselves still only relies on their immediate location. And because these ants don&#x27;t know where &quot;home&quot; is, they&#x27;re even dumber than real ants that actually do have some sense of direction.<p>Anyway, refinements on this simulator or links to other simulations that illustrate these ideas are absolutely welcome! I&#x27;d definitely update the article if we found a way to improve upon what I&#x27;ve done.",

        "text": "Well, it&#x27;s good to have a hard-compiled language that&#x27;s (almost) memory safe. Three problems with Go:<p>- The Go mantra is &quot;share by communicating, not by sharing&quot;. Then look at all the thread examples in &quot;Effective Go&quot;.  They all share memory, while trying to construct locks using message passing.  Multi-threaded Go programs are not memory-safe. That&#x27;s why Google won&#x27;t let you use them on their AppEngine.  Compare Erlang, which takes message passing seriously.<p>- The lack of exceptions is resulting in hacks using the &quot;panic&quot; mechanism to create an exception mechanism.  This is where we were with &quot;longjmp&quot; in C.  I know someone at Google who has constructed a language on top of Go mostly to deal with exceptions.<p>- The lack of generics is resulting in hacks using the reflection mechanism to create generics. This is painful and slow. Go has generics for built-in objects; channels and maps are parameterized types, so there&#x27;s already syntax for instantiating a parameterized type.  Extending that to user-defined types would no be too bad. Fear of the C++ template mess seems to have been the problem.",

If you&#x27;re particular, that might mean only messaging one or two people per day depending on your style. What happens if you get that one match per week from Dating Ring and you automatically are not attracted to them based on appearance or personality? There are certainly people who seem really interesting and then they message me back and then it&#x27;s pretty clear that we&#x27;re never going to have a fun conversation, and you move on. Hard to do that with one match per week. I know online dating can be tedious at times, but let&#x27;s be honest, going to bars all the time or picking up a ton of new hobbies to meet new people is even more time-consuming and from what I&#x27;ve seen from myself and many other people definitely less fruitful.",

        "text": "Predicting who people will be attracted to is not actually that hard, and if you get a match and aren’t attracted, you tell us why and we’re able to improve future matches. Heck, some people email us pictures of their exes and we use that to send them better matches. You’re right that similarity &#x2F; interests &#x2F; and whether you’re attracted are all important. This is something that we can predict really well. A big part of this though is that people (especially women) are so inundated with ‘matches’ and messages on other sites that they never meet. OkCupid had a great recent blog post that showed that the power of suggestion is just as important as the matching algorithm. So what’s nice about our service is that people are much more likely to meet, since they only get 1 match and because of the matchmaker suggestion. This is not to say that it’s not worth using OkCupid or going to bars or picking up hobbies but I’d say to do them all. What’s $20 if it means a 1% higher chance of meeting your next partner? I know people hate putting a value on love, but the happiness I get from my partner is worth at least a million bucks (he cooks and cleans..). I was single for 3 years before meeting him, and if someone had told me there was a 1% chance of meeting him, that would be equal to $10,000. So even if you don’t agree with my math, $20 is still a far cry from 10k, and I would have paid a lot of money to have spent less time single. Of course, tons of people are fine being single or dating around, so it definitely depends on your priorities.",

        "text": "Given that there is already a completely free API for background checks provided by the federal government... wait, is it because that API is convoluted and patently insane?  So is sanity their real product?<p>Also, the way the federal background check system works, requests have to come from originating agencies that are set up to interface with the federal system.  Is Checkr going to interface directly, or are they going to do what most companies do and go through a state agency?  If going through a state agency - which one?  The fee that states charges varies RADICALLY... in some states, you pay basically what the federal govt charges ($14.25).  In others, they charge upwards of $300 per transaction to just submit your data and relay the answer.<p>Also, there is a new service called &#x27;Rap Back&#x27; which enables someone who runs a background check to sort of subscribe to a persons background... so if new items arise, like new arrests or the like, they can be notified.  Will Checkr support that?<p>I don&#x27;t really understand the link to &#x27;on-demand economy&#x27;... at least at the federal level, a background check will tell you nothing except whether the person has been convicted of a &#x27;serious crime&#x27; (the definition of serious crime varies widely from state to state... in Oregon almost all traffic violations are &#x27;serious&#x27;, while in other states nothing short of murder qualifies).  You don&#x27;t get to know when or what crime or anything like that, just &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.  Do you really want to avoid anyone who might have had a domestic violence issue in 1972 or a speeding ticket in Oregon 20 years ago?",

I&#x27;ve been a &quot;PC&quot; my whole life, and have somehow gotten away with never buying an Apple product, and never felt the lack.<p>However, many of the reasons I avoided Apple in the past are now irrelevant, as all but Linux now attempt the same fascist business model (The rings&#x2F;rules of Apple QA for software, and One store with which to rule them all).  My go-to argument against Apple in the past was:<p>&quot;In order to get an application or piece of software into the Apple ecosystem, you have to go through Apple.  Apple has a strict QA process, every app that gets into the store has to vetted by one of Apples legions of QA staff.  This sounds good; we want quality apps.  However, a great deal of Apple’s QA rules for acceptance aren’t just about app quality, but also nebulous ideas of morality and ethics.  The problem with that is, when only one agency is in control of what is proper and what isn’t, we are left with a situation where one agency gets to control what you see, use, and by environmental influence—think.  Now, imagine everyone exclusively owns an Apple product…”<p>Ironically, this notion is very 1984, and my stance on it was a bit extremish to be sure, but hey, I’m a PC.  Anyway, ever since Windows 8 and Windows Phone, it seems Microsoft has seen how completely Apple controls its own ecosystem, and wants a piece (complete with its own app ecosystem).  Suddenly Babylon had arrived on my desktop.  My initial thought was, “are we going to reach a situation where there are no more open platforms to develop for?  Are we going to get to a point where software can only be deployed through stores run by the same folks who run my OS? Do I have to learn Linux?!”<p>So, long ramble short, I’m thinking of joining the cult.  A few years back I was given an iPad as a present.  I initially resented it, labeling it a glorified TV-ala-Netflix device.  I have since spent hundreds on app purchases. \nIs now a good time to put on my robes and worship at the altar of Jobs?",

        "text": "Incidentally, what gets me the most about reading the experimental procedure is how they went about testing and how easily it would be to defraud such a system.<p>There are techniques for <i>exactly</i> measuring heat output of significantly more powerful generators without relying on simulations of designs of radiators and air flow. Consider that thermal solar plants produce megawatts of power during the day, several orders of magnitude beyond the E-Cat, and yet all of the technology around thermal solar generation measures to within 1-2% of reality, reliably. If they can be so precise on energy measurement at the scale of a utility, it is laughable that they would even try anything other than industry-standard techniques.<p>And color me an asshole, but I don&#x27;t buy that the &quot;high&quot; temperatures of 1500 degrees is a legitimate challenge to measurement, considering that other nuclear technology currently under development operates at millions of degrees and can be measure with much better guarantees of precision, despite also having to deal with deadly radiation and neutron emissions.<p>But no, instead of using fully trusted energy measurement procedures, which would work perfectly fine with a 2300 watt nominal heat generator at 1500 degrees (1.5MWh seems like a lot, but it&#x27;s only 2300 watts over 32 days, roughly the amount of energy it would take to run two decent microwaves for that period of time), they simulate and estimate based on temperature sensors and IR cameras.<p>And even ignoring their questionable measurement procedures, 2300 watts of fraud would be trivial to inject into a system like that with a handful of magnetrons and a waveguide... like how a microwave works.<p>If I, a computer scientist with a reasonably modest level of physics and chemistry education (from 14+ years ago) can think of several methods by which to trivially defraud observers (via measurement methodology, or by injecting external power remotely), and that their testing methodology seems purpose-designed to defraud, it makes me ask two simple questions:<p>1. If this is a fraud, in what world did they believe that this turd sandwich would actually be believed?\n2. If this is not a fraud, why wouldn&#x27;t they have used an industry standard measuring methodology instead of throwing all of this other measuring bullshit into their paper, citing the proprietary nature of the measurement devices, while simultaneously claiming precision.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I think it would be awesome if this were real. But if I wanted to make claims and defraud observers, I&#x27;m not sure I could design a better setup for fraud.",

You would think with the trove of information that Amazon have as well as the incredibly smart data scientists they employ they could have analysed their treasure trove of info to see that a phone with restricted access to applications, sub-par hardware and overpriced retail cost would not sell very well. Heck, even without analysing any data, you would have the answer. What makes this situation even weirder is Jeff Bezos is a notorious data-driven decision maker. He is a numbers guy, he does not usually make decisions based on impulse or the need to compete, so I do not know how things got to this point.<p>Does this mean that Amazon are out of the smartphone business because of one failure? Not necessarily. Amazon have the money, the power and means to release something spectacular, but they will need to learn from their mistakes as well as their competitors and go back to the drawing board. I honestly would not be surprised if they already have a new phone in the works already.<p>One area Amazon could beat their competitors on is price Even though you can already buy a whole bunch of affordable Android phones, they usually come with horrible hardware and are made of the cheapest materials possible. If they can release a phone with a decent camera, proper unrestricted Android OS, plenty of RAM, removable battery, great GPU&#x2F;CPU and get the cost low enough that it wipes the floor with Google&#x27;s offerings and price point, we would have a viable fight on our hands.",

I think people are annoyed about the fine because it basically sends the message that you can pay people only 15% of the minimum wage and if you get caught the fine will be just about 50 cents an hour, or ~8% of the amount stolen from the employee. That&#x27;s less than what I pay in sales tax when I purchase goods from a store.<p>Now you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s better than large sweatshops where hundreds of people may be underpaid. And it may well be that these employees were put up by the company and din&#x27;t have to spend anything on rent or food, so while they were only being paid $100&#x2F;week to work here they might have been coining it by Indian standards. But as I said above, even after the payout and fine the firm got a bargain! How much would you budget for 6600 hours of IT department grunt work?",

This objection is usually backed up with relativity, and the increasing amount of energy required as C is approached.<p>My objection to this is orangutans.<p>Orangutans are amazing creatures. Placid but intelligent, social and all in all an interesting specimen from nature. But you cannot teach them calculus. It&#x27;s simply impossible. Their brains are not capable of dealing with concepts that are necessary.<p>What does this have to do with UFOs? There is a chance that there are concepts in the universe of which our brains are unable to conceive, just like orangutans and calculus. These concepts may be necessary to achieve travel over interstellar distances.<p>I understand that this is an unprovable statement. It is, nevertheless, a (admittedly fluffy) rebuttal to the &quot;relativity forbids FTL travel&quot; objection that is raised when the subject of UFOs is discussed. We have seen glimpses where savants are able to perform mental tasks that are amazing to &quot;normals&quot;, giving hints that such things might at least be possible.",

I doubt they can. A doubling every 50 days is x160 every year.<p>I think claims of being able to predict market prices should be met with great skepticism. Especially prices of easily traded commodities, including bitcoins.<p>The only proper measure of an ability to predict market prices is profit, because profit also measures the extent of the predictions: how much can you move the market (by trading according to your predictions) until you can no longer predict what will happen? Obviously, there&#x27;s a limit. No one can extract unlimited profit from any market. So there definitely <i>is</i> a limit to how much you can earn from your algorithm. If you can earn 10% p.a. on an investment of maximum $5000, your algorithm isn&#x27;t really worth much. If you can earn 1000% p.a. on an investment of up to $100M, your algorithm is <i>great</i>. But without knowing these figures we really only have a claim, seemingly a claim of them being able to make <i>a lot</i> of money, but choosing not to do so.",

Imagine an API that give them access to list of tens of thousands of people in every city that they launch who have already have background check and updated information of their driving records and vehicle. Another opportunity is to offer insurance to this rising number of people who are joining these companies (e.g. Uber, Lyft, SideCar, Instacart, Postmates, Washio, Zipments, Deliv.co, Shoprunner, Doordash, Fluc, Drizley, Drinkin, Saucey and etc.)<p>If anyone is interested to work on this topic I would love to share my experience and thoughts because after all it is about the economy of sharing :)",

I bought my daughter an iPhone 6 from Verizon (because of the $200 trade in offer). My daughter&#x27;s screen cracked within a month. The Apple store gave her a new phone, no charge. Couldn&#x27;t have been easier. The only thing the store needed to do was to remove the SIM from her old phone and pop it into her new one.<p>But I agree with your general assertion. Absent a strong financial incentive (in this case a much better trade in value) or other extenuating circumstance, I would always buy directly from Apple.<p>Edit: just wanted to add, I think that Apple is &quot;being good&quot; in this, the very early phase of iPhone 6. My daughter claims she didn&#x27;t drop her phone (ha ha) and the crack was very similar to pictures I&#x27;ve seen of &quot;bendgate&quot; where the break occured near the weak points of the phone. So Apple doesn&#x27;t want more negative publicity about this. If it were six months from now, Apple might be much less accommodating.",

        "text": "&quot;Sorry but comparing a dictatorship to Facebook is a little off, by any standards.&quot;<p>Nope, you are confused about the difference between comparing and equating. It is perfectly reasonable to compare an amoeba to an elephant, and to highlight similarities between the two (for example, both use DNA for genetic information), and the confusion is on your part if you think that therefore an amoeba weighs multiple tons.<p>&quot;Yes, there were several projects that opted for a decentralized version of Facebook and all of them failed to gain any traction. Why?&quot;<p>What do you think? You made the claim, it&#x27;s not my job to provide the evidence.<p>&quot;What are the facts that are already happening related to Facebook that affect the populations?&quot;<p>Just read this thread for examples? The most obvious example: Some people who value their privacy are excluded from some parts of social life due to network effects&#x2F;social pressure from facebook, even where the loss of privacy is not an inherent part of the respective activity. That&#x27;s a loss for these people at the very least, and not unlikely to also be a disadvantage for society as a whole, if such people are effectively removed from the social fabric of society.",

Mathematica at least doesn&#x27;t really contain any &quot;magic&quot; in the actual algorithms and uses pretty well-known methods that are for the most part documented, if not open-source. Most of their competitive advantage is in the design of the language itself, the interface and in their internal virtual machine. These details aren&#x27;t really things you would get any insight into with a &quot;show the work&quot; mode.<p>Your first reason is totally right though. &quot;Show the work&quot; mode requires a lot of extra stuff, because the way a person reasons through solving some thing like an integral isn&#x27;t much like how a computer solves it. To make it spit out something really comprehensible to a person, you have to have lots of heuristics and it isn&#x27;t generally very reliable. Even automated theorem provers (which Mathematica has some very basic functionality for) spit out rather hard to follow or extremely long proofs. Those are much more rigorous and less reliant on heuristics than a CAS and still don&#x27;t produce &quot;pretty&quot; output (AFAIK, I&#x27;m not super experienced using automated provers or proof assistants).<p>Showing steps has been done before, e.g. by Macsyma like OP mentioned and by Wolfram too (Alpha does it).

If this is how you communicate to your boss, no wonder he is ignoring you - your English is as bad as your young colleague&#x27;s code. Sorry to be so blunt, but it&#x27;s true. If you just wrote this in a hurry, then do yourself a favor and rewrite it to be clearer - and I will delete this criticism.<p>On to your main problem - your boss likes his new employee, from a combination of novelty and because it sounds good to say &#x27;I have an Ivy League guy on my team.&#x27; This is very unfair to you but it&#x27;s a common situation in human psychology. As you are at a Big company, you should have some way to talk to someone in human resources and explain your problem in general terms, to ask what the appropriate strategy is. Definitely get that advice before making a decision.<p>It seems to me that you have 3 basic options here: ask for a raise, ask for a transfer, or work-to-rule. Asking for a raise, you are basically saying &#x27;hey, I am having to manage this guy in addition to my own job, it&#x27;s a lot of extra work.&#x27; Ask for a transfer gets you out of the situation, and while it&#x27;s disruptive for you it means the new guy becomes Someone Else&#x27;s Problem. However that&#x27;s a rather passive-aggressive strategy, which I don&#x27;t think is a very good idea. Third option is to say &#x27;of course I&#x27;m here to help you understand our in-house libraries and our codebase etc., but handling compiler output errors and so on are the sort of skill you have to build up for yourself.&#x27; If he still can&#x27;t cope, bring him to your manager and say &#x27;he (or we) need&#x2F;s some more training with this compiler, Big Co should send him&#x2F;us on a training course to improve his&#x2F;our skills.&#x27;<p>I don&#x27;t think you should blame your colleague too much for his lack of a team player mentality. Bear in mind that not only may he lack experience dealing with production code, he is probably also unfamiliar with professional and social &#x27;rules&#x27; of the workplace. He has mostly been in college with peers of the same age and school year surrounded by supportive faculty and the ability to work on new projects rather than deal with legacy code. So he probably does not understand how much of your mental resources he is consuming. At worst he thinks you are biter and burnt out because you are not so obviously excited to be working at Big Co and you probably don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cool to eat cold piazza and write code until 4am.",

        "text": "It seems you&#x27;re arguing theoretically, and that maybe I moved a little too quick in my previous post and wasn&#x27;t clear.<p>What I actually suggested above was buying the SPYs and selling covered calls. The only risk you&#x27;re taking on is limiting your upside to your strike price.<p>Tell me this: what can an investor do to increase his probability of success in a trade other than reducing basis? The argument for reducing basis is simple: Reducing the amount you&#x27;ve paid for the shares, making them cheaper for you than somebody just buying the stock, gives you an edge.<p>The monthly sd in SPY is $9. So yes, if you sell the $205s, 85% of the time the calls you sell will expire worthless OTM, and when that happens if you roll your position forward another month, doing that will increase your total profit over just holding the stock. Limiting upside to increase odds of profitability is the lynchpin of professional trading strategies. And that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing here.<p>And yes, selling 1 and 2 lots, commissions do absorb a larger percentage of your PL than on bigger transactions. And complex strategies that require 4 legs like an Iron Condor won&#x27;t be profitable at that size, it also happens that an IC is a low-risk strategy (and thus small effect on your buying power) so in those cases you can increase the leverage or widen the strikes.<p>Your attitude about options is understandable given the way they&#x27;ve been portrayed to the retail investor. And everybody should think about what&#x27;s right for them. But most retail investors buying stock, making directional bets, buying netflix at $500 a share, you think that&#x27;s less risky than buying a $100 debit spread on NFLX with a higher probability of success and massively less capital. And you think that way because it&#x27;s how you and the retail sector has been conditioned for 20 years.<p>And, like I said up top here, the retail sector has underperformed the market. And it&#x27;s not because of evil HFT firms who do nothing but cheapen transaction costs for everybody. It&#x27;s because of the way we trade. It can be better. Check out this TastyTrade video covering a study they&#x27;ve done on reducing cost basis with covered calls:<p><a href=\"http://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/market-measures/episodes/cost-basis-reduction-probabilities-05-06-2013?utm_campaign=learn&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=social-share\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tastytrade.com&#x2F;tt&#x2F;shows&#x2F;market-measures&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;...</a>",

There might also be issues with supporting Lua 5.3&#x27;s integer type [1] in LuaJIT (now you use the C FFI to handle 64-bit integers).<p>At this point, it seems there are two distinct versions of Lua, Lua and LuaJIT.  I have some modules I wrote that support both Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.2, so I can still use them with LuaJIT if need be, but it&#x27;s a pain (conditional code in both C and Lua) and it will only get worse if Lua 5.3 comes out [3].<p>[1] Up to Lua 5.2, Lua only supported one type of number (internally, a double [2]).  Lua 5.3 now supports a distinct integer type, which has its implications (doubles don&#x27;t wrap; you now get x.0 where before you would get x when printed, etc).<p>The reason for 64-bit integer support is that doubles only support integer operations up to 2^53 or so. [3]<p>[2] Unless you changed the internal representation of numbers in Lua, an easy change to make in the Lua sources.<p>[3] I already had to work around 64-bit integers in some code dealing with process limits on a 64-bit system and Lua 5.1&#x2F;5.2.",

Start from there, assume nothing, and see where the evidence takes you. He&#x27;s a breath of fresh air compared to the wacko UFO stuff you normally read.<p>One of may favourite nuggets from him is to look at the whole UFO thing as a cultural phenomenon. Don&#x27;t doubt people, but listen - properly - to what they are saying, and look for patterns. He did this and looked at the standard taxonomy for UFO sightings (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_encounter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Close_encounter</a>), but focused on the exceptions. He found lots of stories that didn&#x27;t fit the standard model e.g. a woman who had seen a humanoid figure just floating in the air for around an hour near sunset before disappearing. No good explanation for that in terms of aliens, so he looks further afield into various elements of human psychology and geophysics.<p>In the end, he seems to settle on the idea of a long term geo-physical phenomenon, which may be linked to the earthquake lights thing (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_light\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Earthquake_light</a>). He posits that this might interact with human consciousness via the very strong magnetic fields that you would expect if such a phenomenon were to occur (perhaps with other mechanisms too). This would explain the varying effects from weak (lights in the sky) to strong (weird hallucination-like experiences), depending on how close you are to whatever is going on.<p>Sounds like a good way to tie all the stories together, especially given that as he points out, UFO stories are quite recent, but other cultural stories with almost identical characteristics e.g. faeries, angels, etc are pretty much universal, so may be the same phenomenon interpreted differently.<p>OTOH, evidence is hard to come by and this is definitely fringe theorising. Interesting reading though, and very thought-provoking.",

There are a couple of areas where Amazon got worse since 2012 on the ecommerce side. First, Add-on items are annoying. Stuff I used to order and get for free now has to be bundled. I get why they are doing this, but it&#x27;s just jarring.<p>Second, their prices actually seem to be getting higher. I can often now find equivalent products cheaper locally. Tools are especially bad that way: Home Depot regularly beats them. Clothing is a crapshoot, but I generally find better sales at local stores as well. Amazon will typically have the best of breed item, while not having a basic version for a reasonable price. For example, last winter I bought winter gloves. Amazon had great ones, with good reviews, etc. but I bought a pair for 80% less that while not as good was very adequate. I checked later and Amazon did not carry this brand or much decent stuff at this price point.<p>Search is getting worse. More products are miscategorized and you have to be very careful about what you buy. Here&#x27;s a quick example, search for &quot;GoPro&quot;. You&#x27;ll get many duplicate options, often with confusing descriptions, in different departments, etc.<p>They are still a powerhouse when it comes to online shopping, but I really wish someone gave them a kick in the ass in terms of pricing and usability.",

I think this is more of an explanation of Fourier Series, but hopefully it gets the idea across:<p>Consider the space around you. Pick some frame of reference with a fixed origin point in space. To specify an object, you must specify the distance along each independent direction (x, y, and z in 3d space) to arrive at the object from the fixed origin. These independent directions are referred to as a basis for the space. Often these independent bases are perpendicular (or orthogonal).<p>For higher dimensional spaces its the same idea. It turns out we can even have infinite dimensional spaces whose bases are functions that can be perpendicular in a certain sense. It also turns out that complex exponentials (waves) are an orthogonal basis for a certain space of functions. This is really cool! It means we can refer to any function in this space using the complex exponential basis functions just like we referred to objects in 3d space using three independent directions.<p>Why is this useful? The magnitude in a particular independent direction in this space tells us about frequency content of that function. So instead of the first coordinate telling you how much x distance there is, it says how much of a certain frequency there is.",

There is no credible evidence for it (although I recognize that credibility standards vary a lot depending on who you talk to).<p>Personally, I find the absence of aliens surprising. This may one day even turn out to be problematic. Most HNers are probably aware of the Fermi Paradox (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fermi_paradox</a>).<p>One of the most likely answers seems to be that space is big and manipulating spacetime for FTL travel might be technologically intractable. Maybe we are living in a galactic dead patch, as a statistical fluke. Maybe technology-building civilizations are astonishingly rare. In any case, we would expect at least a few <i>drones</i> zooming by every once in a while.<p>But the absence of contact might also hint at a severe problem in our galactic region which we have not yet encountered. Another common scenario is that technology using species are so unstable as to exterminate themselves in most cases. It is unclear how such civilizations would <i>all</i> have a tendency collapse though, as it seems that different types of life forms should have vastly different behavioral characteristics.<p>However you turn it, most scenarios mean that more likely than not the galaxy should <i>already</i> have been colonized many times over, and by rights it should <i>at the very least</i> contain a lot of artifacts left behind.

However, lipstick isn&#x27;t (i.e. we spend tons of money on <i>that</i>, when Mars is more worthwhile)<p>• &quot;If you saw a movie with aliens landing, how do they land? Like that. It would be weird if they landed in the ocean with parachutes... LOL&quot;<p>• Q: &quot;With commercial space taking off, what do you think NASA&#x27;s role is in next decade? Besides giving you contracts...&quot; A: &quot;NASA&#x27;s been very helpful to us. Huge fan of NASA. NASA is doing the right thing currently, given its constraints.&quot; (good, diplomatic answer)<p>• Q: &quot;Are there any natural resources on Mars SpaceX could exploit&quot; A: &quot;Even if there were pallets of crack cocaine on Mars it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it to ship back, LOL&quot;.<p>• Q: &quot;A company has announced plans to build to space elevator by 2050.&quot; A: &quot;I don&#x27;t think its realistic, but Id love to be proven wrong. I always think of Charlie and Chocolate Factory when I heard the words space elevator.&quot;<p>• Q: &quot;You&#x27;ve consumed lots of Sci Fi. What art has contributed towards your zeal?&quot; A: &quot;As far as key influences? Star Trek, it&#x27;s a positive view of future. Star Wars was first movie he saw in theater, was super great. LoTR is his favorite book series, despite it being sort of anti-technology. Foundation Series is one of best ever. Clarke, Heinlein. Thinks The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is Heinlein&#x27;s best book.&quot;<p>• Q: &quot;I know NASA is working on SLS. They will eventually try to go to Mars. If they do, how does that change your focus as Mars.&quot; A: &quot;We&#x27;ll keep focusing on rocket technology. We want to focus on making Mars travel frequent, not one-off missions&quot; (like NASA)",

        "text": "I&#x27;m quite curious about is the process of bootstrapping an exchange like btc-e.com or vircurex.com. I know a little about market microstructure and orderbook dynamics seems really interesting from the perspective of having an efficient, scalable data structure that can accomodate an arbitrary number of added buys&#x2F;sells and realtime modifications in a highly concurrent setting. \nI think I understand the overall mechanics of an orderbook, but it seems like you would immediately (upon initial deploying or even during dev&#x2F;testing) face the problem of &quot;OK I will make the first trade of this new exchange&quot; and submit a SELL order for 1 BTC for $351.5 (example figures), whereby nothing happens because you don&#x27;t have any liquidity whatsoever... That is the first thing I am wondering about. Does every exchange just implement their own orderbook? I read this post that explained a good way to design an orderbook (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantcup.org&#x2F;home&#x2F;howtohft_howtobuildafastlimitorderbook) and it was useful in understanding how they work, but in the real world context of building a working application, I&#x27;m experiencing a disconnect in how to realistically get users that would be willing to use it early on when it&#x27;s just running on testnet.\nOn a very superficial level this appears similar to the issue of any application that is dependent on a bidirectional relationship (Amazon has buyers and sellers, Airbnb has hosts and guests) but the unique aspect of an exchange web application is the fact that the orderbook concept doesn&#x27;t really equivalently exist in other marketplace structures so the process of bootstrapping must be significantly different than what you&#x27;d do for a dating website (example).\nI am looking for some input and just general thoughts about how the process of building out an exchange would entail with regard to making it a liquid market with a deep orderbook from as early on as possible. \nThank you in advance, I look forward to and would appreciate any feedback.",

        "text": "I stopped reading at ..&quot;To lobby for disclosure implies that there is something to disclose, which is highly dubious.&quot;... just like how it was highly dubious that the NSA wasn&#x27;t spying on everyone, right? come on. This thing, if it&#x27;s real is 100 times BIGGER than any previous government scandal - all the more reason to not disclose it (yes I know, circular argument). But the proper counter arguement is to watch the 2001 Disclosure video - in there you have dozens of Ex-military, NASA and US government employees (many of them high ranking) <i>ready and willing</i> to testify before congress on the matter.<p>Think about it, admitting aliens exist and are visiting us means:<p>1) They likely know how to travel across entire galaxies in their life-times (likely hours&#x2F;days)<p>2) They have invisibility technology: UFOs are often reported to appear out of thin air and disappear back into thin air.<p>3) Their propulsion technologies completely baffle us. Tens of thousands of UFO witnesses (including many hundreds confirmed on radar) have reported to have travelled thousands of miles per second, to then stop on a dime or do 90 degree turns and carry on as if gravity could be ignored.<p>4) If even a single abduction story is real, they have the ability to paralyze any human being and teleport them through walls and ceilings. They also have the ability to find any single human anywhere on Earth as many self-confessed  abductees have reported they tried to move across the country, yet the aliens always found them and just continued abducting them. It also begs to question their agenda and morality - WTF are they doing with humans they abduct?<p>5) If any of the military UFO stories are real, they can out maneuver every single fighter jet humanity has ever created - exactly zero UFOs have been shot down by military planes, despite hundreds of chases having been documented by pilots and radar operators. Roswell UFO crash is rumored to have been taken down by experimental military radar tests, not intentional military weapons.<p>My personal theory is that given how vast the Universe is, it is entirely possible that some (millions?) planets were formed before Earth and at least many dozens&#x2F;hundreds&#x2F;thousands (?) evolved life to the point of human intelligence or greater, THOUSANDS of years before humans ever walked our Earth. This would translate to there being X number of alien civilizations out there far more advanced than humans technologically and more than likely biologically advanced (think brain power x 100+).<p>Consider how we&#x27;ve gone from horse and carriage to putting a man on the moon and creating space crafts that can travel 20,000 km&#x2F;hour (in space) in a mere 300 years. Now imagine the capabilities (if you can) of what an alien species only 10,000 years more advanced than us might have. What about 100,000 years? 1 Million ?  Their technology would be like magic to us - completely unimaginable ... you know like travelling across entire galaxies in mere hours, teleporting through walls, having invisible craft, shooting paralyzing beams, erasing memories of (some) human abductees etc.<p>Why is it so hard to imagine and believe that other intelligent civilizations on other planets exist and that they might be thousands if not millions of years ahead of us?",

        "text": "This is purely speculative, but for me it looks like Larry Page may be preparing Google towards becoming a more privacy-aware company that you can entrust with information.<p>Why do I think this?<p>Trend: I think that 2014 has led to consumers becoming more actively aware of privacy. Google will be aware of consumer behaviour changing in this space. I have noticed in my general non-techie personal circle that people are far more protective of personal data and changing their online behaviour compared to two years ago. I think this is Google&#x27;s current Achilles heel.<p>Tech: Google has so far got the best track record of security implementations which are open to anyone using their end-to-end platforms. They could seriously leverage this capability as a differentiator if it wasn&#x27;t for the perception that they &#x27;snoop&#x27; on its users.<p>Mission: In contrast to this Trend Larry Page has always been enthusiastic about a big vision of how consumers can benefit from sharing information to the right people, for example in the health space. At I&#x2F;O 2013 this was a big topic for him: so many people&#x27;s health could be improved if they would be able to comfortably share their personal data with the right people. The true value of this has massive potential.<p>Indications for a Pivot: Eric Schmidt is currently touring Europe, stating that Google doesn&#x27;t &#x27;read&#x27; email and does not make its money from analyzing your personal data. \nIn the end Google&#x27;s best bet may be to try to transform itself into a personal, trusted data company.",

Imagine a market with 1000000 shares bid at $4 and 100 shares offered at $4.01, it&#x27;s more likely to tick up than down in the very near-term. This isn&#x27;t tradable though since the predictions aren&#x27;t large enough to overcome the spread and you can&#x27;t expect to join the 1000000 share bid and trade when it&#x27;s good (the 1000000 shares that made you think it was going to move up all have to trade or cancel for you to trade, not looking so great anymore).<p>Real HFTs use other features of the order book, movements in related products (maybe a move in oil futures in the last minute impacts the price of an airline stock in the next 10 seconds, etc.), and so on.

        "text": "People won&#x27;t onboard a freelance developer for a short project unless they are desperate (and startups can often be desperate in different ways), but they will onboard advisors and consultant leaders to get them through tough periods. The difference in actual day-to-day can be minimal, but it&#x27;s how you present yourself. &quot;I&#x27;m a CTO&quot;, not &quot;I&#x27;m a dev (also a CTO)&quot;.<p>You could become a consulting CTO for hire. Talk to some of the startups in your target group, and to non-technical founders, to understand more about what they would pay for, and what results they would want to see in order to pay the bill. For example, selling the product might not be the goal; raising investment is more likely.<p>For some, it may simply be coming in, assessing the state of things, making a list of recommendations, and hooking them up with full-time CTO candidates.<p>For others, having a technical advisor who can screen, interview and hire their future tech team is incredibly valuable.<p>For MVP building in the specific stage you refer to, as others have said, profit sharing isn&#x27;t a particularly reliable model. The MVP may never take off, and by the time it does, they may have built a whole team and rewritten your code.<p>Other than content, here&#x27;s one thought. What if you built up a set of talented developers who need your skills too - junior folks looking for exposure to portfolio projects, senior devs happy with a 9-5 but wanting some intellectual stimulation and to learn new techniques and technologies. Then effectively set up a MVP shop, where you manage the first stage of the &#x27;idea to code&#x27; pipeline, but hand off the bulk of the implementation to others. Perhaps these others bill hourly and you get a cut. You can even be a broker for just introducing the two and still get a cut, though smaller.<p>One thought, I think that this pattern of work can be detrimental sometimes. An engineer joining a startup doesn&#x27;t want to see a bunch of spaghetti code written by some consultant who is no longer around. It&#x27;s often the case that she has to deal with it, but it can be a red flag of sorts. There&#x27;s a whole second set of consulting needs around transforming a messy MVP which has started to show traction into a scalable, reliable product. It&#x27;s uglier, harder, and therefore probably harder to find people who are truly good at it. But a lot of that may be relationship-based -- understanding what the startup leaders really <i>want</i> and what&#x27;s working, translating that into new requirements, and keeping them happy if the work required to make it scalable is a lot more complex than it seems from the outside.",

        "text": "Cost and environmental metrics for this project and the whole idea of solar roads simply makes no sense.  One has to wonder what&#x27;s at play here.  Why is something like this funded when it makes no sense?<p>From the article:<p><pre><code>  - It&#x27;s 30% less efficient than roof-mounted systems\n  - Each set of panels is encased in concrete and glass\n  - These systems cost 3x more to install\n</code></pre>\nMy notes on the above:<p>The 30% drop in efficiency is a dream. It&#x27;s worst than that.  Fill the road with bikes dirt, trash, grease, oil and surface abrasions (or cars in the case of a future solar road) to get real numbers. This simply isn&#x27;t sensible. It&#x27;s akin to building a solar array and planting huge trees over it.<p>The fact that the panels require thick concrete and thick truck-proof glass makes this terribly expensive.  There&#x27;s an environmental and energy cost here.<p>In other words, environmentally, it takes a lot more pollution (waste materials and the overall industrial process) to make each of these panels than it does to make panels that don&#x27;t have to support a truck.  Imagine these modules being made in China to be shipped via tanker truck to Europe or the US while burning millions of metric tonne&#x27;s of nasty polluting bunker fuel.<p>Ditto for energy.  It takes energy to make, transport and install heavy glass and concrete. I wonder if these panels will ever make back the energy required to manufacture and install them.  No data on this, of course, just educated conjecture on my part.  I do think I&#x27;m right.<p>On the matter of cost, it should be obvious that such an installation is massively more expensive than roof-mounted panels.  I would go as far as suggesting this might be massively more expensive even in the case of roof mounted panels when a structure has to be built to support them.<p>Maintenance costs would be very high, requiring constant washing, cleaning, removal of leaves and dirt and polishing just to maintain the substandard energy production level offered.<p>What would the cost and performance metrics be if you took the same length bike road, built a structure over the entire length and mounted the panels atop this structure?  My guess is that cost would be significantly lower.  Maintainability would be massively cheaper and easier.  And energy production efficiency would gain perhaps an order of magnitude when compared to a road full of bicycles, dirt, leaves, etc.<p>Such quick analysis --didn&#x27;t even have to open a spreadsheet-- makes me believe projects like these have to be politically driven at some level.  I can&#x27;t see any economic or technical angle whatsoever under which something like this makes sense even at a small scale.  And I don&#x27;t think that scale makes it better.<p>I wonder if someone familiar with what led to the approval of such a project might be able to shed some light with further details.<p>EDIT:  Spelling.  Added a bit about maintenance.<p>EDIT #2: To address the &quot;if we covered every rooftop we would only produce 25% of the energy the country needs.&quot;<p>What a fantastic problem to have that would be!<p>Look, at that point you build steel structures atop all the main train tracks and mount solar arrays kilometers long all over the country.<p>Not enough?  Build similar structures atop roads where it makes sense and put solar arrays there.<p>Not enough?  Can you add more wind power.<p>Not enough?  Can you add wave&#x2F;tidal power generation<p>Not enough?  Can you add nuclear.<p>Not enough?  Can you make a push for more efficient power utilization?  BTW, this is probably the best thing the world could do.<p>Not enough?  Well, if the goal is to be 100% solar --which might not be sensible-- you are going to need to use all available surface area as efficiently as possible.  Destroying your roads to then install solar roads is unlikely to produce the desired results.",

        "text": "Your story for Shyam would be wonderful.. I want the immigration system to work like that!<p>However, it does not. A university graduate that is looking for an entry level position cannot just request a green card! I have been there, actually. As a graduate from a US university, with good grades, wanting to stay in the US. This is how it actually works. Without at the very least a standing offer, a foreigner can&#x27;t even apply for the green card. The company has to say they can&#x27;t find a qualified American, prove that the foreigner is qualified have to wait until the green card is handed out before working there. For a recent graduate that would mean an EB-3. Even if you come from Europe, the wait for that is of years. Nobody will hold the job for that long, so that route is impossible.<p>So this is what a foreigner with an American CS degree has to do. First he gets an F1 visa, and looks for a company that would sponsor him further. He better hope it&#x27;s a good fit. In that period, he has to keep the company happy, and then get sponsored for an H1-B. Let&#x27;s remember that H1-B periods are today open for 1 or 2 days a year, thanks to the H1-B mill companies. Then, once we have the H1-B, the company gets to decide if they want to sponsor for permanent residency. This will take years, and cost tens of thousands of dollars. Only after that, we get back to the position where Shyam is in your story.<p>I am a pretty good example of the real version of Shyam story. I graduated in 2000 from a US university, and went though the immigration maze while working for a variety of US companies. I got my permanent residency in 2011. I did not go through staffing companies, but many people do, because while it provides a way worse service for your employer, it&#x27;s far, far safer for the employee. If they get hit by a round of layoffs that says &#x27;effective immediately&#x27; while getting that green card, they have to go back home, or stay illegally. The staffing company will not lay them off: they will just not pay them while they hand them another position: For all intents and purposes, they become a shell company that keeps their immigration status safe, in exchange for a very big pay cut.<p>In my case, there was only one close call, when my first employer lost a big contract for their product, and started doing rounds of layoffs, shrinking their workforce in the US by a factor of 10. When I saw what they were doing (and that I did not share the nationality of the company owners), I got another job 2 weeks before my department received their notice.<p>So If you want more stories of immigrants that come here and compete honestly, and that you&#x27;d want to have on your team, wish for better immigration legislation, because the current system actually promotes your scenario B. The immigrants don&#x27;t like it either.",

We were told that the features, and the OS updates to support them, would be available before the hardware launch, but only just. There were apparently issues with setting up a large networking infrastructure to rival Sony and Microsoft that they hadn&#x27;t envisaged.<p>This was surprising to hear, as we would have thought that they had plenty of time to work on these features as it had been announced months before, so we probed a little deeper and asked how certain scenarios might work with the Mii friends and networking, all the time referencing how Xbox Live and PSN achieve the same thing. At some point in this conversation we were informed that it was no good referencing Live and PSN as nobody in their development teams used those systems (!) so could we provide more detailed explanations for them? My only thought after this call was that they were struggling - badly - with the networking side as it was far more complicated than they anticipated. They were trying to play catch-up with the rival systems, but without the years of experience to back it up.<p>As promised, (just) before the worldwide launch we received the final networking features that we required for our game along with an OS update for the development kits that would allow us to test. So we patched up our code and tried to start testing our game.<p>First up we had to flash the kits to the retail mode that had the Mii and network features. This was a very complicated manual process that left the consoles in a halfway state. In the retail mode we could test our features and ensure that they worked as expected, which would be a requirement for getting through Nintendo certification, but in this mode the debugging capabilities were limited. So we could see when things went wrong, but we couldn&#x27;t fully debug to find out why. As developers, we had to make a choice and hope that any issues that you found were due to the (untested) OS code and wouldn&#x27;t happen in the final retail environment. What should have been simple tasks were long-winded and error prone. Simple things like sending a friends request to another user were not supported in the OS, so you had to boot a separate program on the console manually, via a debug menu, so that you could send one. But if any error occurred there was no way to debug why it had failed, it just failed.<p>We started to ask questions about how they could possibly launch the console, which was a matter of weeks away, with a partially developed OS. How were they going to get the OS onto all of the consoles that had been manufactured up to that point? Was it just that we got it late, but they had pushed it into the production line earlier?<p>Launch day came around and the answer became clear: Nintendo was late - very late - with its network systems. In fact, the only way to access their systems fully was to download a big patch on day one that added all these missing components. Without that patch a lot of the release titles would have been only semi-functional.&quot;",

        "text": "I 100% agree.  People think ADD&#x2F;ADHD is &quot;resolved&quot; on meds, but it&#x27;s not the case.  They started me on 27mg of Concerta, then 54mg, then I was (thankfully) moved to Vyvanse and titrated my way up to 60mg.  The story hasn&#x27;t changed - it&#x27;s still valuable to leverage the downsides into strength.  An ADD&#x2F;ADHD brain is certainly a chaotic one, but going on meds has enabled me to do better planning&#x2F;execution and to actually complete tasks.  Your wall of TVs analogy is great - I often describe my head as the similar murmur you hear from a crowd.  Thoughts are like white noise where it&#x27;s nearly impossible to pick the right one out, let alone stay with it for a while when it&#x27;s so easy to hear everything else on top of it.<p>Not to sound skitzo, but I think the meds do a great job of quieting that noise.  While medicated, I have the ability to plan a task or project, execute each step, and actually stick with it to the end.  It&#x27;s still possible to get off task, and perhaps worse if you do (since then you&#x27;re REALLY focused on being off task), but the meds still help me think.  But that is where it stops.  They don&#x27;t resolve problems - they provide most of the tools needed to change the way you think so you can work on resolving them yourself.<p>Now, to the popular point of diet and exercise; I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a mix of improved medication delivery, the natural stress relief, and the endorphin benefit that comes with it - but eating well and regularly exercising seems to amplify the medication&#x27;s benefit by 15-20%.  Those two things are marginally helpful without meds, along with several other &quot;natural remedies&quot; that I have tried, but I think a combination of all of the above is key.<p>My original point was just that the article makes it sound like symptoms should be treated via introducing new parts to the equation which ultimate distract people from boring situations.  Yet, ADD&#x2F;ADHD in its TRUE FORM works 100% independent of one&#x27;s desire to pay attention.  The argument of &quot;BUT VIDEO GAMES ARE FINE SO IT&#x27;S CLEARLY CHOICE&quot; is 100% falsified by Dr. Thomas E Brown&#x27;s research.  He provides such excellent insight - I am so fortunate to have met him.<p>I&#x27;ll close this novel of a post with an analogy made by Dr. Brown when we met:<p>&quot;Picture a massive old wooden sailboat with dozens of crew frantically fighting to pull the sails, keep up with the demands of their job, etc.  Non-ADD&#x2F;ADHD folk can get a benefit from medication, but it just speeds up both the captain and crew.  \nADD&#x2F;ADHD folk, on the other hand, are instead sailing through a terrible storm at a much faster pace than normal and can hardly see - but the crew still keep up with their jobs.  The captain is the problem.  In this case, the captain is the only one sped up by the meds, and suddenly, no matter how chaotic and messy that voyage is, it&#x27;s all under control.&quot;",

The theory is that&#x27;s because businesses are frantically borrowing in the short term to keep themselves afloat while they work their excess inventories down.

But I tried installing a (4 year old?) multi-function printer under Ubuntu 14.04 a few weeks ago and was never able to get the scanner to work, despite Brother providing Linux drivers. Some co-workers and I haven&#x27;t had great experiences with webcams under Linux. Touchpad support is there, but whether gestures and multi-touch work is another matter. Overall, Linux drivers are a far cry from plug and play in my experience, and I really don&#x27;t care if I have to run an installer once as long as it ends up working.",

As I understand it, <i>normally</i>, as the US (and I and my family) experienced in the &#x27;70s, these policies would be viewed by borrowers in such a way they&#x27;d demand more interest for lending their money to the government, through combinations of perhaps rising inflation and perceived regime risk (which rising inflation is an example of, by eventually liquidating debts for less real value).<p>&quot;This Time It&#x27;s Different!&quot;, which they always say (and is the title of a recommended book on the subject, an 800 or so year study of this game).  The theory I hold to as of now is that the world-wide nature of the Great Recession and other factors like the artificiality of the Euro have made the US dollar, and US government debt, the &quot;least worst&quot; place to put your money.  Well, in any quantity at least, e.g. I remember tiny Switzerland (GDP ~1&#x2F;32nd of the US) getting very concerned about &quot;hot money&quot; inflows into their franc and maybe taking some actions WRT to them.<p>The PRC is also something of a wild card: they watched the debacle of Indonesia, where a short term liquidity crisis was treated by the IMO as a typical 3rd World unsustainable government debt crisis, resulting in needless hardship and the ousting of its long term strongman.  The CCP decided to make sure that didn&#x27;t happen to them and have as a result acquired vast foreign wealth&#x2F;debt holdings, including plenty of US government debt.",

Most other cities don&#x27;t come close, DC being a notable exception. But even then, the traffic here lasts longer and stretches further. Angelenos don&#x27;t measure distances in miles, we measure it in how long we expect it to take.<p>Parking can be a hassle in specific places, but for the most part you can find space near where you&#x27;re going at rates that are reasonable. Although there is less free parking than many other cities.<p>But at the same time, LA is a city of neighborhoods all mashed together, and some of those neighborhoods are quite walkable. I live within a block or two of a ton of restaurants and shops, and within a short 5-10 minute drive of 90% of my needs.<p>It&#x27;s sucked when I&#x27;ve had jobs that required cross-town commutes, but otherwise it can be quite pleasant.<p>Lot of taxis here. Lot of Uber&#x2F;Lyft.  Lot of Town Car services for the entertainment industry (when you see that town car heading in the neighborhood for a 4:30 AM pickup, you might not envy the actor&#x27;s life too much).<p>As an aside, I&#x27;m actually impressed at how fast the subway system is currently growing. Unlike some cities, projects here are getting completed in years as opposed to decades. The subway&#x2F;light rail is very different from 10 years ago, and will be very different again in 10 more years.  It&#x27;s still a huge, spread out city, but Metro is tying it together relatively quickly.",

Not everything is great but its one of the most advanced tax APIs in the world imo. The bug reporting process is a bit broken, but after the bug was reported they called us back and gave us information about the fix!<p>I am also deeply optimistic about India&#x27;s progress in the next decade because of the new PM and the strong focus on development.

        "text": "I remember when I was about 23 and anticipating moving out into my first apartment - in Manhattan no less! - I would go into Tower Records and browse for CDs to buy. It was a symbol for me of my independence and ability to select my taste in music, for my pad. There was a time when having a collection meant something. I missed the vinyl generation, but a few years after I had already bought probably $200 worth of CDs, Steve Jobs did that major thing - disrupting the music industry by introducing iTunes.<p>No one else had been able to pull it off before - the record industry knew it was a different businsss model, and this was one of Steve&#x27;s massive business <i>coups</i>. Music was being shared as files online - this gave businesses a legal way to compete with that. Apple launched the whole &quot;1000 songs in your pocket&quot; industry.<p>Today, for most people, it&#x27;s no longer about your song collection. Tower Records has closed along with and the disruption of the physical delivery continues apace, led by Amazon and its massive consumer power. The future is squeezing of publishers, which will need to find their own ways to collectivize. But this is the macroeconomics of it. I want to mention the social impact on the individual level.<p>I no longer download songs to iTunes, or rip them, except for the times I go traveling or on a cruise. Music has become a social phenomenon, and for that it is better to have a free legal music source IN THE CLOUD. I just had a house party and we used a simple web app I created a few years back called YouMixer (<a href=\"http://youmixer.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;youmixer.com</a>) that uses the YouTube API as a source of free, legal music and lets everyone contribute to the playlist.<p>Facebook has since broke the login, and I have to recode that app. But creating a music mix works, everyone gets to add their songs and hear them at the party, and I think this is the future. Your preferences and songs following you where you go, so listenng to music is a social event unconstrained by downloading collections. I believe paintings will follow the same pattern in the next 5-10 years, and new formats for players - both audio and visual - will appear which will help usher in this social phenomenon.",

Fortunately CD&#x27;s came out when I was in middle school, so I was buying CDs when I really started building my own music collection.<p>I remember filling my shelves with CD cases, and I remember noticing that I wasn&#x27;t listening to my full range of music because of the friction of having to switch physical discs. Then my friend and I each bought a 400-disc carousel player [0]. That thing was magical - suddenly we could listen to any song we had ever bought at the press of a few buttons. I remember using Access to make a database of all my music, so I could easily listen to anything I wanted to.<p>Around 2006 I bought a 30GB ipod, and I methodically ripped every CD in the 400-disc changer, which I had completely filled. I remember writing to my friend and telling him that every song in that changer was now in my pocket. It was another revolution in making all my music available with even less friction.<p>Fast forward to today, and what do I have? I&#x27;m still listening to music on my 2006 ipod. I&#x27;m stuck there because I don&#x27;t use itunes anymore, but my old ipod still works. I haven&#x27;t made the time to update my approach to organizing music. I had a dream just last night that my ipod burned up, and I had to figure out a new way to listen to music.<p>I&#x27;ll dedicate some time in the next year or two to organize my music outside of itunes. I still have all my old CDs, so I could rip them again if there&#x27;s reason to do so.<p>Music has been changing formats for the last 100+ years. It&#x27;s a bit of work to keep up with the changing formats, but I am always grateful that we have easy access to our entire collection of music at the touch of a few buttons.<p>Edit: I also lived in NYC in the 90&#x27;s, and I miss going to Tower Records and HMV and getting lost in there for hours at a time.<p>[0] <a href=\"http://content.abt.com/image.php/big_cdpcx455.jpg?image=/images/products/BDP_Images/big_cdpcx455.jpg&amp;canvas=1&amp;quality=100&amp;min_w=450&amp;min_h=320&amp;ck=334\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.abt.com&#x2F;image.php&#x2F;big_cdpcx455.jpg?image=&#x2F;ima...</a>",

The whole context of this discussion is related to Microsoft&#x27;s SkyDrive, which is a free cloud service offered to MS customers. It even provides photo and document backup if you want it. I suppose it may not be as developed as iCloud (for iOS devices) but I don&#x27;t see a principled difference in the two systems.<p>Moreover, the purpose of the recovery key doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to data backup. If your disk fails or you lose your device then there are two cases:<p>1. You backed up your data, either to the cloud or to an external backup disk. In this case the device encryption and recovery keys become irrelevant. That&#x27;s because device encryption is only applied to data on internal drives.<p>2. You didn&#x27;t back up your data. In this case your recovery keys are useless, since you don&#x27;t have the data.<p>So it seems like the use-case for recovery keys is primarily for situations where the user has forgotten his&#x2F;her password. Saying that Apple&#x2F;Google don&#x27;t need to care about this because they have cloud backup (and implicitly MS doesn&#x27;t) seems like a bit of a cop out.<p>&gt; In this context &quot;much more limited&quot; is against: almost every government in the world, private individuals, and against private companies. So, what, like 98%+ of the world&#x27;s population?<p>Much more limited against someone who can get your computer&#x2F;tablet&#x2F;phone and guess a password or some security questions.

Since &quot;ABC&quot; * &quot;BD0&quot; = (x + y) * (x - y), then equating &quot;ABC&quot; = x + y and &quot;BD0&quot; = x - y, you can solve to get x = (&quot;ACE&quot; + &quot;BD0&quot;) &#x2F; 2, which is the same number no matter the order between A and B, or between C and D. Then maximizing (x + y) * (x - y) means minimizing y^2; or, making the two numbers &quot;ACE&quot; and &quot;BD0&quot; as close together as possible, which leads to the given solution.",

The reality is that almost every application is broken by default. Only recently have Chrome and Firefox been useful with touch. The beautiful experience in IE and Explorer were the only places where that happened. It really sucked to be held back from doing something because the system started to fight me.<p>Windows - The above complain is more specific, but this is more my disdain for the Windows Platform. There aren&#x27;t good touch OS alternatives to Windows for the surface, so Windows stays, and it&#x27;s not very good at open source things. I prefer Linux, or even OS X like I am using now, over Windows and the surface.<p>~That said, I do like the surface if these things can be fixed\nPros of the surface:\n- The pen really was amazing, OneNote used it perfectly\n- Gaming wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it was pretty powerful for the size as well\n...

CD&#x27;s are much more expensive in Japan than in other parts of the world - typical prices are in the $25-30 USD range.  The ~$1&#x2F;song doesn&#x27;t really work over there.<p>2. Japan has (or had) CD <i>rental</i> stores.  Like the Blockbuster of yore, you can go and rent a CD, take it home, copy it to minidisc (this is late 90&#x27;s japan, remember!), then listen to it forever.  This was quite common - one of my roomies had a case of about 100 minidiscs that were all copies from rentals.<p>So, the market is really different over there - minidisc and laserdisc both caught on to significant degrees, whereas it didn&#x27;t anywhere else.",

Spread spectrum technology (and the infinite variance in frequencies of light a single optical cable can carry) mean that there is no real scarcity of capacity.  And while there are limits, there are huge swaths of spectrum that can be used, but that the government is keeping off the market to increase the revenue it gets from the &quot;auctions&quot;.  There&#x27;s enough money in the industry to run separate cables.  Many larger cities ran fiber rings and these could handle many, many competing providers.  The cost of laying fiber to one cable complex is fixed, while the number of providers that could use it is pretty high (multiple providers per fiber and multiple strands per cable, and hundreds (thousands?) of wavelengths per fiber.)<p>Further we&#x27;ve already seen what the government has done with the internet-- they tapped it.  They started recording everything. They weakened cryptography.  They have forced people to give up private keys.<p>They have proven that they cannot be trusted with something as sacred as the internet.<p>So, while &quot;regulating&quot; the internet might seem like a savior now-- we all get the bandwidth we&#x27;re paying for-- and I&#x27;d certainly like that[1]--  I believe the end result will be further consolidation into ever larger, and fewer players, all of whome are very closely tied with the government, and even less privacy or security.<p>Ultimately resulting in a return of an AT&amp;T like monopoly which has no interest in innovation because it has no competition.<p>Back in the &quot;old days&quot; of the internet, the primary impediment to getting good connectivity was AT&amp;T and its remains after it broke up (into smaller still highly regulated and not-at-all-interested-in-what-you-wanted-to-do-with-THIER-phone-lines.)<p>[1] I find it astounding that in south america, where the entire country has to share a single optical connection to north america I could watch netflix in HD, but here in a city that google is currently wiring for fiber, I can only get Netflix on SD over my &quot;40 megabit&quot; cable modem.

Also, training is often marketed as compensation, and companies can&#x27;t have it two ways: it&#x27;s either compensation or it&#x27;s not, and if you market it as such then clawing back the &quot;value&quot; of training is as unethical as clawing back the cash you paid the employee for the time they were there.<p>I&#x27;ve had a few experiences interviewing South Asian guys on H1-B visas where they were trying to game the interview really hard and it was awkward at the time and I was angry after the fact that this person had made it past a phone screen. Reading what life is like for these guys, I&#x27;ll have a little more empathy next time.",

        "text": "But let&#x27;s look at the economics from the ISP&#x27;s perspective.  What incentive does the ISP have to charge Netflix less, <i>regardless</i> of whatever costs they have?<p>First of all, most big ISPs are competitors to Netflix.  Directly so through online streaming services, but I think focusing on those is missing the big picture, which is cord-cutting.  For cord-cutters, Netflix and other services add up to a replacement for the ISP&#x27;s expensive TV service, and while not a lot of people do this today, the trend over the last few years seems pretty clear.  Thus the ISPs have little reason to be particularly invested in general in making high bandwidth transfers on the Internet actually work.<p>Aside from that, they could be incentivized by competition from other ISPs.  But 75% of American homes have only one ISP providing at least 25&#x2F;3 [1], and even at 4&#x2F;1 the majority only have two choices, so this is pretty limited.  While I am very far from an expert in this field and I know there are many factors involved, it&#x27;s hard to see this as not a large factor in the high prices Americans pay for Internet service compared to other countries, independently of the inherent scarcity of the resource (which, after all, can be expanded with enough investment).<p>And when it comes to charging content providers, the situation is worse, because the cost is hidden.  Even in a competitive market for ISPs, fees charged to Netflix don&#x27;t affect the sticker price - admittedly, at the moment it seems to be all of $1, which is a significant part of Netflix&#x27;s price but not the Internet connection&#x27;s [2], but that just reinforces the arbitrariness of it.  And if negotiations fail and the ISPs slow down Netflix connections by neglecting to upgrade equipment, they can still advertise 100Mbps or whatever on their website, regardless of the fact that on one of the most popular destinations (bandwidth-wise) on the Internet you can&#x27;t even get 5Mbps!  This is such an enormous asterisk to the speed promise that even given the inherent variability of speeds on the Internet, it feels very much like false advertising.<p>This used to affect me personally: being in the minority that has two high-speed options, somewhat less than a year ago I switched my home&#x27;s Internet connection from Optimum Online, cable service which AFAIK is not trying to charge Netflix a fee, to FiOS.  For the same price it promised faster download (150 vs 100), much faster upload (now symmetrical, yay), and there were faster options potentially available in the future if we were willing to pay even more money.  As it turned out, for most of the internet FiOS really was better - even if I could rarely ever download anywhere near 20 MB&#x2F;s, 10 wasn&#x27;t out of the question for CDNed content, significantly better than the previous service.  But the result was to the significant displeasure of my family, because instead of downloading games from Steam, they watch <i>Netflix</i> a lot, and it started frequently degrading quality or failing altogether.  As someone aware of the issue I honestly should have know that would happen... IIRC, since the connection was far from perfect under the old ISP I thought it wouldn&#x27;t make that much difference, but I was wrong.  My fault - I think largely resolved now that Netflix is paying up - but the vast majority of consumers are completely unaware of this!  Any non-tech-enthusiasts choosing service during the time had little way of knowing about this giant caveat, giving Netflix no bargaining power even in this competitive segment of the market.<p>I suppose this part at least could potentially be changed without government intervention: Netflix could raise its price only for users of certain ISPs, or ISPs could start advertising their Netflix speeds.  But with all these factors combined, the whole thing is a mess and in no way represents an efficient market.  Thus while I hope for competition to some day make net neutrality-like regulation unnecessary, I strongly support such regulation.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairman-more-competition-needed-high-speed-broadband-market\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;fcc-chairman-more-competition-ne...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/05/netflix-comes-through-with-price-hike-after-struggles-with-comcast-verizon/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;netflix-comes-throug...</a>",

During a visit to India, he\n  continued working on the project.\n\n  When the project was complete, Wipro told Paul that a\n  mistake had been made: While he was away, he should have\n  been switched to Wipro India for lower Indian wages,\n  according to emails Paul shared with CIR.\n\n  A company representative asked him in one email to sign backdated\n  agreements and return salary he’d already been paid. When Paul\n  refused, he said Wipro withheld pay, benefits and documents he needed\n  to maintain his immigration status – and threatened to hold his visa\n  hostage.\n\n  “They wanted to take all my salary,” Paul said. “I was forced and\n  coerced.”\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve been overpaid by my employer in the past, usually the money just disappears from my account a few days later with no intervention on my part (like a partial ACH reversal). It wasn&#x27;t my money to begin with, so I had no right to contest it. Even though it was nice to see the extra balance for those few days, it wasn&#x27;t mine to keep.<p>If I had transferred the money out such that the reversal was not possible, I&#x27;m sure it just would have been withheld from my next check (a.k.a withholding pay&#x2F;benefits). Now the part about withholding documents sounds illegal, but so is keeping the ill-gotten salary. This of course assumes that Paul was in fact <i>over-paid</i>, which is what TFA says, so safe to assume.<p>Several of the anecdotes in the story have weird details like this where it&#x27;s not 100% clear who is screwing who.

Until recently, music from one company (say Sony) was only available from their digital music store, which had their own player app with their own DRM. These things create significant inconvenience to the consumers, hindering the adoption of digital music.<p>* The music industry in Japan came up with a brilliant business model that enabled them to sell the same CD multiple times to the same consumer, basically by bundling a ticket to each CD. Sometimes a single ticket grants you one vote, sometimes you get one piece of (say 12) tickets randomly and you need to complete all 12 pieces to get something. This forces loyal fans to buy 10s and sometimes 100s of the same CD.<p>It&#x27;s not like people are carrying around portable CD players any more, so these factors obviously creates a rapidly diminishing music fan base. I still hope that eventually the decline in the CD business will force the industry to wholy embrace the digial music, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.",

        "text": "I think the author&#x27;s criticisms are mostly invalid (see Chevalier&#x27;s comment for a great takedown). With MOOCs, I worry more about these things instead: 1) MOOCs lack the social&#x2F;deadline pressure to get people to finish their work, and 2) people learn by doing things actively, which is much harder to encourage over the internet.<p>For 1, as a person with ADHD I struggle to get work done. The deadlines and social pressure to meet them are sometimes the only thing forcing me to actually do work. If people formed local communities to push each other to finish their MOOCs, that would help, but this isn&#x27;t built-in to MOOCs directly like it&#x27;s built-in to traditional universities.<p>For 2, I think people only learn when actively doing something. Passively listening to a lecture does nothing; the lecture only becomes knowledge when you think about it or use it in some way. Active learning exercises are harder to build in to MOOCs because one of the best ways of evaluating learning - having someone &quot;qualified&quot; look at your work and provide feedback - isn&#x27;t scalable. Multiple-choice questions are too easily gamed and rarely encourage deep thinking. Things like discussions, or iterative feedback on problem-solving, or essay critiques are much more useful, but again, not easily scalable.<p>It might be that forums where other students critique your work or help you through difficult assignments could be a good substitute. But maybe not. I&#x27;m a teaching assistant for a computer science department, and it&#x27;s difficult to encourage a student in just a right way to help them get the answer for themself. It&#x27;s tempting to just give out the answer, which isn&#x27;t helpful for the student but is much easier for me. The collective wisdom of a forum might not be a good substitute for the subtle patience of a professor.<p>However, neither of these concerns mean we shouldn&#x27;t pursue MOOCs. I want MOOCs to one day be a complete substitute for a university education. But to do that, concerns like these will need to be addressed.",

I know Rust has iterators but I don&#x27;t think those are quite the same?<p>Rust uses lazy iterators for everything (including functions like map, and datatypes like arrays).<p>Rust actually has a full hygenic macro system (metaprogramming). IMO this is one of the coolest things about Rust.<p>Rust does not use reference-counting GC. Instead, it has a fairly unique borrow checking system for garbage collection, which not only handles cleaning up memory but also cleaning open sockets, file handlers, etc. There is a generic type implementation of a reference counted variable you can use, though.<p>Although there are no &quot;pure functional&quot; (i.e. side-effect free) guarantees in Rust AFAIK, the borrow checker actually catches a lot of issues that pure functional programming is meant to fix (i.e. issues from unexpected state mutation). Also, variables in Rust are immutable by default, you have to use the &quot;mut&quot; keyword to make them mutable.",

At the very least, if this really is an intractable lag problem (which I doubt - other manufacturers seem unaffected), then the driver should call an OS API that says something like &quot;latency-sensitive user input has started&#x2F;stopped&quot;, and then the OS makes the decision about whether to boost the CPU frequency, or do something more sensible, or be updated in future to use new hardware features to solve the problem even better, etc.<p>This particular hack is just poor engineering. And users should at least be given the choice between &quot;drain my battery or add a bit of lag&quot;, if the manufacturer can&#x27;t figure out how to remove the need to make that choice.",

Multi-billion dollar highways enable sprawl and cheaper commercial parking lots.  Driving &amp; parking personal vehicles is incredibly wasteful from a broad economic perspective (but it was the correct path -- a necessary evil in the absence of density to enable effective mass transit).<p>Even with the government subsidies, Uber is an economically competitive alternative to driving &amp; parking personal vehicles.  That&#x27;s the amazing part.  Public policy favors the incumbent behavior, yet &quot;ride-sharing&quot; has still been able to expose market inefficiencies.  Imagine if we killed all the parking subsidies, or better yet: used economic incentives to discourage driving &amp; parking personal vehicles, and encourage the behavior that had a lower total cost.<p>I believe the future of personal transportation is computer-driven computer-dispatched vehicles, a game Uber and Google are leading.

Cantonese and Mandarin split roughly 1000 years ago, whereas the difference between Shakespearian English (which is considered Early Modern English) and Modern English is only a few hundred years. In addition, Modern English is a descendant of Early Modern English whereas Cantonese and Mandarin are not descendants of one another.<p>The Chinese writing system tends to obscure these differences because cognates among the different varieties of Chinese are represented using the same characters, even though their pronunciations have diverged considerably. There are vocabulary and grammatical differences as well, though they are not as big.<p>The difference is more akin to if English speakers had to write in German†, but because they generally don&#x27;t know how to actually speak German, they would read it using English pronunciation instead. For instance, if you wanted to say &quot;I know that you said that&quot;, you might have to write:<p><pre><code>    Ich weiß dass du das gesagt hast.\n</code></pre>\nBut you would read it &quot;in your own language&quot; as:<p><pre><code>    I wit that thou that y-said hast.\n</code></pre>\nThis is similar to the current relationship between Cantonese and Mandarin. Cantonese speakers write in Mandarin (i.e. &quot;Standard Chinese&quot;) and read it &quot;in Cantonese&quot;, even though when speaking, they would really say something almost completely different. When Cantonese speakers actually write in Cantonese, Mandarin speakers generally would have difficulty reading it.<p>† The difference between English and German actually spans more than 1000 years, but I&#x27;m not as familiar with other closer Germanic languages with which to provide a good example.",

In fact, more or less the opposite is true. ... Cognitive tests correlate because all of them truly share one or more sources of variance.&quot;<p>(2) &quot;Shalizi’s second error is to disregard the large body of evidence that has been presented in support of g as a unidimensional scale of human psychological differences. The g factor is not just about the positive [correlation matrix]. A broad network of findings related to both social and biological variables indicates that people do in fact vary, both phenotypically and genetically, along this continuum that can be revealed by psychometric tests of intelligence and that has has widespread significance in human affairs.&quot;<p>(3) &quot;Shalizi’s third error is to think that were it shown that g is not a unitary variable neurobiologically, it would refute the concept of g. However, for most purposes, brain physiology is not the most relevant level of analysis of human intelligence. What matters is that g is a remarkably powerful and robust variable that has great explanatory force in understanding human behavior. Thus g exists at the behavioral level regardless of what its neurobiological underpinnings are like.&quot;<p>Conclusion: &quot;In many ways, criticisms of g like Shalizi’s amount to “sure, it works in practice, but I don’t think it works in theory”. Shalizi faults g for being a “black box theory” that does not provide a mechanistic explanation of the workings of intelligence, disparaging psychometric measurement of intelligence as a mere “stop-gap” rather than a genuine scientific breakthrough. However, the fact that psychometricians have traditionally been primarily interested in validity and reliability is a feature, not a bug. Intelligence testing, unlike most fields of psychology and social science, is highly practical, being widely applied to diagnose learning problems and medical conditions and to select students and employees. What is important is that IQ tests reliably measure an important human characteristic, not the particular underlying neurobiological mechanisms.&quot;",

The most recent issue with my MBP in fact doesn&#x27;t show up on any of these forums: it involved the keyboard and trackpad being totally irresponsive when my MBP woke from sleep. After many wild goose chases such as “reset the SMC”, I stumbled onto the fix by luck. Turns out it kept looking for a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse on waking up, totally ignoring the peripherals <i>integrated into the notebook itself</i>. The solution? Turning off Bluetooth. Sure, simple enough to fix, but “turn off Bluetooth” is not far from “you&#x27;re holding it wrong”.",

Like working on a Google Docs document... except that it&#x27;s for code, and collaborators can all use whatever supported editors they like.  When they went to add support for Vim, they ran into problems with the &quot;real-time collaboration&quot; part... because Vim is single-threaded and doesn&#x27;t have a non-blocking event loop:<p><a href=\"https://news.floobits.com/2013/09/16/adding-realtime-collaboration-to-vim/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.floobits.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;16&#x2F;adding-realtime-collabo...</a><p>So they kinda hacked together the means for a non-blocking event loop, and submitted it as a patch to Vim:<p><a href=\"https://news.floobits.com/2013/09/17/adding-settimeout-to-vim/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.floobits.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;17&#x2F;adding-settimeout-to-vi...</a><p>The Vim maintainers kept rejecting it, for different reasons each time.  After two months of back-and-forth, the Floobits guys asked the Vim guys to either give a comprehensive list of things in the patch that need to be different... or else acknowledge that they simply don&#x27;t want the event loop thingy merged at all, and that Floobits should move forward with their own fork of Vim instead:<p><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_dev/-4pqDJfHCsM[1-25-false]\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;#!topic&#x2F;vim_dev&#x2F;-4pqDJfHCsM[...</a><p>Personally, I don&#x27;t have an opinion one way or the other on the merits of that patch.  However, I think the Floobits guys were justified in feeling frustrated about the Vim guys dragging their feet and not being completely forthcoming.<p>Either way, if you do some quick web searching, you&#x27;ll notice that Floobits became pretty big fans and online promoters of NeoVim from that time forward!  So much so that you kinda have to take it with a grain of salt.<p>I&#x27;m not exactly sure what to even think about NeoVim.  They&#x27;ve been plugging away for over a year, their GitHub repo has over a hundred contributors and two-thousand commits, and yet it&#x27;s still pre-alpha?  Also, the primary purpose seems to be allowing people to write Vim plugins in any programming language.  However, it&#x27;s not like the Vim ecosystem is hurting for plugins today.  Besides, the whole point of &quot;vimscript&quot; is that it&#x27;s self-contained and baked-in as part of the editor.  Totally cross-platform, and always there.  If I install a NeoVim plugin, then I have to make sure I have the right version of Ruby or Python or whatever on my box to support it?  Yuck, no thanks.<p>As near as I can tell, any real value-prop for NeoVim is using it as an embeddable component.  Like the Cloud9 guys&#x27; cloud-based Ace editor (<a href=\"http://ace.c9.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ace.c9.io</a>), or as something that IDE makers could bake into their desktop IDE apps.  I don&#x27;t really see what&#x27;s compelling about it head-to-head with standard Vim, assuming it ever fully ships.",

At the extreme, you want to get paid back in real terms, not &quot;NuDollars&quot; (hmmm, Heinlein assumed inflation of at least 3 orders of magnitude in the time <i>Citizen of the Galaxy</i> was set).  Or why we talk about &quot;real&quot; interest rates, subtracting inflation.  Of course, let&#x27;s not get into how the government is scoring inflation nowadays, or how everyone admits that the cost of education and medicine don&#x27;t track official inflation at all....<p>As I understand it, the &#x27;70s were &quot;normal&quot; in that that sort of response is what you really should expect from such policies.  Check out the book, which I bought but have only glanced at.<p>The smashing of the Phillips Curve, the official, written into law as I recall, relationship between inflation and unemployment, wasn&#x27;t considered normal at the time, e.g. the word &quot;stagflation&quot; was coined to describe it.  But skimming the Wikipedia article on it suggests that it was never true, or at least not for more than the short term.<p>And the &quot;&#x27;70s&quot; economic agony was rather long term.  E.g. you won&#x27;t read it in Wikipedia, but LBJ closed the gold window to all but central banks in 1968, i.e. moving it much more to the political arena by cutting out &quot;speculators&quot; like George Soros.  That was a near catastrophe of the &quot;black swan&quot; type ... at least to them, who thought we could afford both &quot;guns and butter&quot;.<p>With a slow end in the early &#x27;80s, delayed in part by the phasing-in of Reagan&#x27;s tax rate cuts required by the Democratic House, conveniently providing an &quot;It&#x27;s Morning in America&quot; 1984 campaign theme as &quot;Reaganomics&quot; vanished from the vocabulary ^_^.",

        "text": "I&#x27;m the guy kansface mentioned. I&#x27;ve spent a decent amount of time figuring out how to make my programming experience better.<p>I&#x27;ve tried almost every editor out there: Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, Textmate, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, and Atom. I&#x27;ve customized them all with plugins. I&#x27;ve even written plugins for most of them. My first editor was pico, quickly followed by Vim.<p>My toolsmithing goes beyond editors. I&#x27;ve tried different keyboard layouts to improve typing speed, settling on dvorak with qwerty shortcuts. I even gave chording keyboards a shot. I built Ag[1] to search code faster.[2]<p>I don&#x27;t own a mouse. If I want to point at something, I use a trackpad. Switching to&#x2F;from it is much faster than grabbing a mouse.<p>People don&#x27;t want to hear this, but I could not be as fast in Vim. Even if Vim had every feature in my current setup, it would still be slower because Vimscript executes synchronously. Executing plugin code blocks Vim&#x27;s UI. If a plugin spawns a subprocess, the UI will be blocked until it exits.<p>With Vim, you can&#x27;t start a search and examine another file while it&#x27;s running. This problem can be worked-around by using multiple Vims or searching from the command line, but then you lose quick opening&#x2F;replacing of results. You can also abuse certain AutoCmds and updatetime to get a sort-of working async execution, but it requires each plugin have its own event loop.<p>I agree with kansface: Vim users may type less, but they don&#x27;t move faster. I have yet to see a Vim user who has impressed me with their speed. I typically see wasted motion, waiting for commands to finish, and fixing mistakes in regexes. Even your example invocations are as good or better in Sublime Text.<p><i></i> <i>I want to add an extra parameter to this method I just wrote. ... I just press &quot;f)&quot; to jump to the closing parentheses and start adding text.</i><p>That does not jump to the end of the function definition. That does a search for ) on the current line. If your cursor isn&#x27;t on the right line, you&#x27;re SOL. Also, ) shows up in many places. It may not be part of a function definition in the language used. In my setup, &quot;cmd + r, up&quot; goes to the previous function definition no matter the language. If I want to go to the end, that&#x27;s ctrl + m.<p><i></i> <i>I want to replace everything on the current line, starting from my cursor position somewhere in the middle of that line. ... I instead just press &quot;c$&quot; and start adding text.</i><p>For me, that&#x27;s ctrl + shift + e, (start typing). Unless you have a $ key, both are three keystrokes.<p>If you use Vim and you&#x27;re happy with it, great. But I would heavily discourage anyone from switching to Vim. Editors and UIs have come a long way in the past 25 years. Even with nerdtree, YCM, and other plugins, Vim can&#x27;t catch up. NeoVim looks promising, since it fixes Vim&#x27;s architectural problems.<p>1. <a href=\"https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ggreer&#x2F;the_silver_searcher&#x2F;</a><p>2. <a href=\"http://geoff.greer.fm/2011/12/27/the-silver-searcher-better-than-ack/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;geoff.greer.fm&#x2F;2011&#x2F;12&#x2F;27&#x2F;the-silver-searcher-better-...</a>",

It also has go-like channels and can be used with both N:M (green) threads and os-native 1:1 threads. It handles streams of data quite well.<p>All variables and references in Rust are immutable by default and accessing global mutable state can only be done in explicitly marked unsafe code. I <i>think</i> that all functions that have no &quot;mut&quot; or &quot;unsafe&quot; in their signature are pure unless they use an &quot;unsafe&quot; block. Exposing unsafe behavior in a safe interface is a contract violation and considered a bug.<p>There&#x27;s no built in laziness, but because Rust allows for overloading the pointer dereference operator, it should be possible to implement thunks in a syntactically transparent way.<p>Rust has a full macro system. There are AST-based macros for when you need a serious amount of power, but most macros are implemented on a partially structured token stream and are implemented a lot like scheme&#x27;s syntax-case. It&#x27;s a lot cleaner than metaprogramming in dynamic languages like python and ruby IMO, and it has no runtime overhead.<p>Introspection? No, but I think doing something about that is on the post-1.0 roadmap.<p>Garbage collection. A reference-counted pointer like C++11&#x27;s shared_ptr is available in the standard library. Its use is discouraged, though, in favor of structuring your code to work with Rust&#x27;s lifetime system and borrow checker. Doing that, your memory is managed in a safe way with no runtime overhead, you don&#x27;t have to worry about reference cycles, and the structure it enforces in your code tends to be easier to follow (although often harder to come up with).<p>Rust isn&#x27;t really meant to be used in place of Scala, it&#x27;s more of a &quot;competitor&quot; to C++. It keeps C++&#x27;s promise of &quot;don&#x27;t pay for what you don&#x27;t use&quot; and strongly favors 0-cost abstractions. It differentiates itself from C++ by using more modern abstractions and garaunteeing safety.",

After the first, or maybe even the second time, does the financial payback for laying additional redundant physical lines make sense?<p>I think that depends on the current market. If there&#x27;s room to make money in the long run by either offering better service or cheaper service, then I think companies will take the plunge and run the cables. In my area, we had DSL over phone lines and cable internet over coax for years. That didn&#x27;t stop Verizon from laying all new fiber to nearly every house in the area. They smelled profit in doubling existing internet speeds in my area. What did nearly stop them was intense lobbying by the existing players to deny them access to run cable.<p>What bothers me is that it required huge lobbying muscles to get through the red tape. What about all the other less politically connected companies with innovative ideas that could revolutionize our connectivity in ways most people have never considered? That&#x27;s the beauty of the Internet. Got a great idea for a new web service? There&#x27;s no government wheels to grease, no need to lobby the FCC for broadcasting permission.

And as we know, reducing calories is just one of many ways to promoting healthy eating and reducing nutrition-related chronic disease.”<p>Other studies[1] have come to similar conclusions, and note that much of the research predicting significant reductions in obesity are flawed because they failed to look at substitution.<p>If you are genuinely interested in implementing a tax (&quot;experiment&quot;) that actually has a chance of producing the intended outcome irrespective of cost, the first study suggested that instead of taxing based on ounces, a tax based on calories would address some of the fundamental flaws in ounce-based taxes like those proposed in Prop E.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.news.wisc.edu/22659\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.news.wisc.edu&#x2F;22659</a>",

It seems to be used (and I initially read your comment in this way) in a negative&#x2F;shaming manner too often, in the &quot;you can theoretically walk so why are you using crutches&quot; sense. There&#x27;s always degrees of control, right? Everyone with ADHD can live without it, but for more serious cases the quality of life would suffer so much that it&#x27;s a question if it&#x27;s worth living without it. That&#x27;s my grudge - mine is so bad and sucks up so much of me that I can&#x27;t imagine getting to a point without meds. Then again I know that&#x27;s a barrier in itself - it&#x27;s hard to imagine having no end date for taking meds and coming to grips with the idea that some part of you is deficient and not everyone is the same.<p>It&#x27;s also kind of funny to me to think of &quot;why need an unnecessary crutch&quot; for everything else because society loves doing it so much for psychiatric disorders but not much else. I got the same reaction from some people over taking antidepressants (my parents gave in then, because yay suicidal ideation). I think it&#x27;s harder to understand and empathize with something that&#x27;s often invisible or an extension of something that affects everyone. My rambly HN comments and commit messages with the 5 minute timer for hyperfocus that you don&#x27;t see looks totally different from me looking pale and coughing a lot.<p>re: pregnancy: stimulants are considered iffy, hence why you also can&#x27;t drink much caffeine - premature births, withdrawal (!), birth defects, and the like. My obgyn, my psychiatrist, and my PCP also like to err on the side of taking as little as possible - I&#x27;m also off TCAs for nerve pain, and had to switch nasal sprays and to lower potency topical steroids for dermatitis - so nobody will write me a prescription. So I can&#x27;t even take Intuniv (non-stimulant, taken at night due to drowsiness, maybe an option for you? meant for children but my adult ADHD-specializing psychiatrist really likes it for adults), not just the Vyvanse I used with it. Meanwhile, the possibility of a fetus exposed to insufficient oxygen for even a moment is so terrifying to them that they&#x27;re willing to put me on _more_ meds if I&#x27;m one of those women that get worse during pregnancy. After I just stepped down due to better control too, dammit. I&#x27;m also expressly forbidden from skirting around exercise, one of my biggest avoidable triggers. Risk management is funny.<p>Thanks though :D and best of luck to you too with your life in general. I planned months in advance to set up maximal coping mechanisms and read a gazillion ADHD help books in preparation for this. If you can cope okay even if not by choice I am super jealous. I&#x27;m having a mini breakdown every day. And of course I went over my timer for this comment. I feel like I can scroll the comments on this story and tell who has ADHD depending on how long their comment is. :P",

Are you editing terabyte-sized source files?  Because if so, then perhaps some refactoring is in order (get the PyCharm guy to do it)!  My mind is boggled by the number of plugins one would need to install in any text editor for the difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution to even be perceptible on a contemporary laptop with a typical file.<p>I mean, if you are happy with your text editor of choice, then godspeed and enjoy (&quot;editor wars&quot; are always a bit tongue-in-cheek).  However, if you&#x27;re adding a slew of IDE-like plugins to Vim (especially a pig like NERDtree), then beyond a certain point it makes more sense to just install the JetBrains product relevant to your language, and use whatever keybindings you like from within that.<p>The way you guys all keep plugging NeoVim (which doesn&#x27;t even have an alpha release yet) definitely smells fishy.

I don&#x27;t know the details of how ISPs are able to price in the UK, but in the US, the ISPs can price however they want to, and many of them have what is essentially monopoly access to their markets, so the pricing scheme that is in use in the US, with mostly flat rates and very little segmentation, is, I am sure, to the ISPs&#x27; advantage, whatever their publicity might say. I suspect that the flat rates are set so that, while people who use full video streaming bandwidth regularly might be subsidized to some extent, people who use much less bandwidth (like me), are paying far more than we would in a true free market, so that on net, the ISP is making much more profit than they would if they truly had to price by bandwidth actually used.<p><i>&gt;the ISP is reduced to negotiating with the upstream providers of packets that are consuming the scarce resource on behalf of their customers.</i><p>No, they are &quot;reduced&quot; (at least in the US--again, I don&#x27;t know what the situation is in the UK) to trying to get upstream providers to pay for bandwidth that their downstream customers, on net, have already paid for (as above). The logic of giving ISPs exclusive access to particular geographical areas (in the US) in the first place was that they would be able to count on a steady revenue stream to fund buildout of the necessary bandwidth. They have now had that benefit (in the US) for at least a couple of decades. If they are complaining that they need upstream providers to pay to fund more bandwidth, that tells me that at least one of two things is true:<p>(1) The ISPs have not used their monopoly revenues for the purpose intended: instead of keeping pace with bandwidth needs, they have just been pocketing the cash; or<p>(2) The ISPs actually have the bandwidth, but they are using their monopoly position to control access to it in order to get paid twice for the same thing.<p>(My personal opinion is that it&#x27;s a combination of both.)",

For this reason, many Cantonese speakers also consider Cantonese to be a dialect as well; however, they consider both Cantonese and Mandarin to be dialects of &quot;Chinese&quot; rather than Cantonese being a dialect of Mandarin.<p>Linguistically speaking, because spoken Cantonese and Mandarin are generally completely unintelligible to each other, they should be considered separate languages, but the the writing system ends up obscuring these differences. There are also be political implications if Cantonese were considered a separate language because of Chinese nationalism tends to see that as a slippery slope towards separatism.",

Situation 2: When you want to share the original with a variation, but continue to use both the new and old structures simultaneously without them effecting each other.<p>So from your comment, you seem to be more familiar with situation 1 and you don&#x27;t seem to be considering situation 2. However, situation 2 does arise quite often in the building of highly concurrent applications.<p>If you don&#x27;t understand the benefits&#x2F;need of situation 2, I can elaborate on that but right now I&#x27;m just going to explain the pros&#x2F;cons of Immutability in both situations.<p>Situation 1: You&#x27;re correct, immutable data structures are more expensive in this context. They are sometimes preferred anyways (I for example prefer them), but that can and should be debated and I don&#x27;t want to get into it. However, they are not as expensive as you are making it seem, there almost never needs to be a full deep copy with immutable data structures (keep reading).<p>Situation 2:\n  let x = { y: y, z: 1 };\n  let x&#x27; = copy(x);\n  x&#x27;.z = 0;<p>Now when x.y.a changes you don&#x27;t want x&#x27;.y.a to change. To make this guarantee (that x and x&#x27; can change state independently of each other) &quot;copy&quot; needs to be an expensive deep copy. ie    x&#x27; = deep_copy(x);<p>However, if you were guaranteed that y and its nested children were all NEVER going to change (ie Immutable). You can now optimize: x&#x27; = shallow_copy(x); Why? because you still have the same guarantee: x.y.a will never change, thus never changing x&#x27;.y.a. x and x&#x27; are then always independent even with a simple inexpensive shallow copy.<p>Really quick to go back to Situation 1: I hope you see here aswell that the majority of the time, you don&#x27;t require deep copies. Example, ImmutableMap.put(k,v) just does a shallow copy at depth=0 since you are only mutating the HashMap itself. I am not an expert and so I&#x27;m not sure, but I think good ImmutableMaps have been optimized even further.<p>Anyways, I hope that helps.",

So is the idea just so passengers could say they&#x27;ve &quot;been to space&quot; (really, just reached a height high enough to be in a super thin atmosphere)?  Or is the idea that by going high enough that you get a few minutes of free fall, to give passengers a glimpse of what being in space is like?<p>Now I realize that the early Mercury program was sub-orbital too, but that was gaining knowledge and practice prior to developing Mach 25 (orbital) technology.

Standard economics theory has long held that &quot;natural monopolies&quot; are possible, in markets with high barriers to entry [1]. Internet infrastructure, with the massive fixed costs of laying wires to every home, is one such natural monopoly. So it&#x27;s not fair to say that the only reason these companies are so big is because of state granted monopolies. AT&amp;T was a monopoly before it became a state sanctioned monopoly. Standard Oil, as well, became a monopoly without very much state aid. While state regulations may make natural monopolies worse, it&#x27;s inaccurate to say that removing regulation (e.g. allowing anyone to run cable or put up cell towers) will automatically end the dominance of Comcast and Verizon.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.economicsonline.co.uk/Business_economics/Natural_monopolies.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economicsonline.co.uk&#x2F;Business_economics&#x2F;Natural_...</a>",

Much of it remains true today.
