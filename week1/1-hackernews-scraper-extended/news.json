The JVM could be as fast or even faster than native (AOT) because JIT can in theory optimize better than AOT.  There are fixes planned for performance issues.  Things have improved since the benchmark.  It&#x27;s only one particular benchmark.  One specific implementation of VM&#x2F;compilers&#x2F;etc.  Let me show you some badly written code in language X that runs slower than language Y on machine Z.<p>In my opinion JIT is always going to be slower than native (AOT).  Maybe the gap will close but fundamentally you can do anything a JIT does AOT at zero run-time cost but not the other way around.  That&#x27;s not a language thing, C++ targetted at a JIT environment (and I think you can target .NET for example) will also run slower and languages that are JITted today could possibly be AOT.<p>The other thing is that if a specific language doesn&#x27;t allow fine control over memory layouts and data types at the native level and&#x2F;or if there are inherent costs in the language&#x27;s design (e.g. duck typing) that is also something that will ultimately prevent it from running as fast as languages that do.  That&#x27;s because you can always build higher abstractions from primitive ones but you can rarely build a primitive one from a higher one.

There are structural problems with this kind of criticism  btw I have upvoted your comment, I do share the vision of a small elegant language yet sufficiently powerful language. At the same time I if some parts of D were to be thrown out I would find a way to complain about it. In fact one of my gripes is that it does not have compile time sum types and pattern matching, that and lightweight and efficient fibres (I believe these abstractions still use OS&#x27;s threading mechanism underneath, I would be very pleased to be proven wrong).<p>The thing is D initially wanted to be C++ done right and then C++ done better. So with that in mind it has to have a lot of features. I do appreciate a lot that D feels a lot more homogeneous and designed rather than built up with unrelenting accretion the like C++. An aspect that I quite like is that if it is not immediately clear what should be the right way to resolve a design problem (for example name clash between function overloading and specialization) the D tendency is to make it into an error till the right solution&#x2F;semantics emerges. In C++ sometimes the choice is somewhat arbitrary: here we have k choices lets pick one and go with it even if it has nothing obviously convincing going for it.<p>I would like to draw your eye towards templates and template metaprogramming. It really feels bolted on C++, and its really tortuous to use. In D however, although it was added much later it gels very nicely with the rest of the languages. Template metaprogramming is nothing special in D. Its just a function like any other except that it and its arguments are evaluated at compile time. (for D developers reading this, please can we have reference counting for CTFE).<p>So yes you are correct, it has a lot of features, given D&#x27;s design scope that is hard to avoid, but these features do fit well enough with each other for a practical language to be used in anger, and fit a lot better than its immediate rival C++ &#x2F; Java.\",\"time\":1404755230,\"type\":\"comment\"}","{\"by\":\"ColinWright\",\"id\":8000145,\"kids\":[8000152,8000386],\"score\":2,\"text\":\"Just some anecdata.

Whether they approve of the current mix of religion and state is another question altogether.  The haredim (sometimes known as &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot;) are a different population altogether; while they&#x27;re religiously observant, the fact that many (or most) of their men don&#x27;t work or serve in the army has been a major source of political tension for decades.<p>Given that about 20 percent of the population is religiously observant, that El Al pilots all come from the air force, and that religious Jews are a growing proportion of soldiers in elite units, I&#x27;m going to guess that we&#x27;ll see more and more religiously observant El Al pilots in the future.

I think from a biker&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s dangerous because their life is on the line. But from a car&#x27;s perspective, bikers are a danger to them finacially.<p>The problems IMO is asymetrical. Bikers put themselves on the line, but it&#x27;s low cost (realatively) and no pre-requesite knowlege on how to behave on roads (no bike exam vs driver exam). A Car has low risk to themselves on the road, but it&#x27;s costly (car cost + insurance + maintenance), and they have to past an exam on how to behave on the road.<p>To a driver: Bikers pretty much break the rules of the road and there isn&#x27;t much consequence execpt an accident. I&#x27;ve never seen a cop pull over a bike for behaving badly. Bikes also have this thing where they can behave like cars sometimes, then behave like pedestrians when convienient. To me this needs to stop. Cities need to police bad bikers, and maybe have some training course&#x2F;licensing for cyclists. There is a right way to behave on the road and I&#x27;ve seen alot of good cyclists, they just have to be more of them.<p>To a cyclist: Drivers need to be punished for dangerous actions against cyclists. Like not checking your mirrors before opening doors, or changing lanes. There needs to be civic campagins from the government urging drivers in the cities to be aware of cyclists and to remind drivers how to co-exists with cyclists.<p>I&#x27;ve thought of both sides of the arguement, I&#x27;ve changed the way I drive and cycle.

They do not consider this dangerous behavior, because they are in control and they know it.

The possibility of abandoning a lot of the C++ cruft and legacy is not something that should be ignored. Whether that compensates for the reduced maturity of tooling as compared to C++ has to be decided on a case by case basis, and this question is going to be a perennial question that would afflict the adoption of any new language. Its hard to have authoritative answers for this. That said I am looking forward to some improvements in D, better garbage collection, better separation of functions in the std library that uses garbage collection, getting the runtime memory requirements down for compiling D code that uses a lot of CTFE, and well if you could add sum types and pattern matching and efficient fibres&#x2F;coroutines that would be very nice.

The original question was probably about static vs dynamic, but I think it&#x27;s important to point out the distinction; especially when reading material like Bob&#x27;s that assumes some familiarity with the terms.<p>From a Curry-Howard point of view:<p>* Static types are logical formulas, values are their proofs.<p>* &quot;Dynamic types&quot; are the clauses of one big disjunctive formula: Int OR Bool OR Error OR Array OR String OR ....<p>* Safe type systems are sound logics; they don&#x27;t let us prove &quot;FALSE&quot;.<p>* Unsafe type systems are unsound logics; they let us prove &quot;FALSE&quot;, and hence anything (ex falso quodlibet).<p>Importantly, the big disjunctive formula used by dynamic languages is <i>trivial</i> to prove. For example, I can prove it with a constant like &quot;10&quot;, without having to perform any computation. Trivial formulas are equivalent to &quot;TRUE&quot; (the logical proposition, not the boolean value!), hence dynamic languages <i>only allow us to prove &quot;TRUE&quot;</i>. This makes them type-safe, since they can&#x27;t prove &quot;FALSE&quot;, but it makes them <i>uninformative</i>: proving &quot;TRUE&quot; doesn&#x27;t tell us anything we didn&#x27;t already know!<p>The only languages which can be type-unsafe are static languages, since they&#x27;re the only ones which can express types other than &quot;TRUE&quot; (eg. &quot;FALSE&quot;). If a static language is unsafe, then there&#x27;s essentially no benefit to it having static types, since we can&#x27;t trust any of the information it gives us.<p>That&#x27;s why academics prefer type-safe languages, whether they&#x27;re static or dynamic, whether or not you agree with Harper that one&#x27;s a sub-set of the other. Unsafe languages specifically hinder our reasoning. Sure, we might be confident that our particular C program is safe, despite C being an unsafe language, but we can&#x27;t generalise that to &quot;for all C programs &#x27;P&#x27;...&quot;, which makes it difficult to study languages-in-the-abstract. Of course, we lose nothing if we make the language safe, so we might as well do that (eg. define a safe sub-set of C like <a href=\\\"http://compcert.inria.fr/doc/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;compcert.inria.fr&#x2F;doc&#x2F;</a> ).<p>Essentially, asking &quot;Why do programming languages researchers seem so enamored with type-safe languages?&quot; is like asking &quot;Why do Mathematicians seem so enamored with sound logics?&quot;. Of course, there is research in non-monotonic logics, para-consistent logics, etc. and that&#x27;s great, but if we&#x27;re going to have an academia-vs-industry debate, then I think the unsound logics, and hence the type-unsafe languages, have the taller ivory towers.<p>Of course, there are many other ways that static and dynamic languages may be safe or unsafe (eg. memory safety, thread safety, non-total, etc.). (Safe) type systems can eliminate some of these problems (eg. memory safety with linear types), but just because it&#x27;s possible with some type-system feature doesn&#x27;t make a language lacking that feature type-unsafe; the worst we could say is that it&#x27;s type-uninformative.<p>For example, Haskell&#x27;s type system doesn&#x27;t distinguish total functions (eg. via a data&#x2F;codata separation). This makes Haskell unsafe with regards to termination&#x2F;cotermination, but it doesn&#x27;t make Haskell type-unsafe. Since dynamic types are completely uninformative, they can&#x27;t solve <i>any</i> problems that type systems are suited to, but that still doesn&#x27;t make them type-unsafe.<p>For example, it&#x27;s not that dynamic languages allow type-unsafe operations like passing strings to &quot;+ : Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int&quot;, it&#x27;s that dynamic languages don&#x27;t allow us to restrict the type of &quot;+&quot; at all; we can&#x27;t even specify that it&#x27;s a function, let alone what that function&#x27;s input and return types are! If it generates a run-time error that&#x27;s fine, since &quot;run-time error&quot; is a perfectly valid value, as far as the type system&#x27;s concerned.<p>Now, we may think this is an unsafe thing to do, but it doesn&#x27;t make the language type-unsafe. It just makes it &quot;semantically unsafe&quot; or &quot;unsafe without lots of tests&quot; or somesuch.\",\"time\":1404756710,\"type\":\"comment\"}","{\"by\":\"mikeryan\",\"id\":8000339,\"kids\":[8000470,8000456],\"parent\":7999814,\"text\":\"You ever see those commercial restaurant spaces which seem like a good spot on paper, but every restaurant that goes into it seems to fail?<p>Thats kind of how I feel about all the &quot;We fixed email&quot; startups.

A driver&#x27;s vision is blocked by window posts, the rear-view mirror, and additional things like object hanging from the mirror and passenger&#x27;s heads. These objects can occlude an entire pedestrian or three.  Secondly, on a bicycle, you will rarely go faster than 30 km&#x2F;h.

If you require a massive pad, buildings, cranes, transporters, cryogenic infractructure, clean rooms for payloads, areas for hazardous fuel filling... And lots of people on the workforce with very specific skillsets.<p>And the kicker: launch only a handful of times per year so all that cost must be put into those launches.<p>Look at a modern airfield gate, all the activity when the plane rolls to it. See all those special vehicles, all the personnel. Some are putting the wheel chocks, some are waving guiding lights, someone connects the electricity line and then come the baggage handlers, the cleaners and the food people. The airplane requires more care on land than things like buses or trains for example. Or look at the people operating the security infrastructure. And the huge buildings out in the distance with the maintenance infrastructure and the workforce.<p>Think if there was just one flight per day per gate, what would the ticket cost be? Or one per month?<p>Actually flying used to be more infrastructure and labor intensive like that, and few people could afford it.<p>The amount of work per passenger mile has to be small for traveling to be possible for the masses. Otherwise we are in an old class society, since only a small elite can be served by a large amount people.<p>It was only with more efficient streamlined mass operations (as well as more efficient and more reliable aircraft) that flying became available to the common people, and finally even cheap. It&#x27;s grown about 20 to 100 fold since 1950. Fuel cost is a significant portion of airline expenses by the way...<p>With rockets we are at an even worse starting point, since they cost roughly as much as an airliner (about a hundred million), yet are used only once.<p>That is the first point. But like demonstrated, solving the first problem is not enough. If the rocket must be &quot;refurbished&quot; after every flight and thus flies only a few times per year, nothing is gained, since all the other costs make the cost per flight so high that launches stay at their almost unusable price. \\nHence real transformational reusable launch vehicles must also be cheap to operate per kilogram to orbit.\\nWe don&#x27;t yet really know how to do all that.<p>Sources:\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/subject_areas/airline_information/air_carrier_traffic_statistics/airtraffic/annual/1954_1980.html\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rita.dot.gov&#x2F;bts&#x2F;sites&#x2F;rita.dot.gov.bts&#x2F;files&#x2F;sub...</a><p><a href=\\\"http://web.mit.edu/airlinedata/www/2013%2012%20Month%20Documents/Traffic%20and%20Capacity/System%20Total/Total%20System%20Revenue%20Passenger%20Miles.htm\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;airlinedata&#x2F;www&#x2F;2013%2012%20Month%20Docum...</a><p><a href=\\\"http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spacex.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;capabilities</a><p><a href=\\\"http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/new-airbus-aircraft-list-prices-for-2014/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airbus.com&#x2F;presscentre&#x2F;pressreleases&#x2F;press-releas...</a>\",\"time\":1404757531,\"type\":\"comment\"}","{\"by\":\"aroman\",\"id\":8000438,\"parent\":8000405,\"text\":\"That&#x27;s not much of a feature, it&#x27;s more like a common courtesy.

I&#x27;m not sure if there was one number in the entire article that wasn&#x27;t manipulated into propaganda.  The text prose was OK but the manipulation of statistics was masterful.<p>Here&#x27;s one example.  If a skinny biker, hit pedestrian me, at a &quot;normal&quot; speed maybe 10 MPH, the kinetic impact would be similar (for me, anyway) to a normal size person hitting me in the hallway.  Oh we&#x27;d both get knocked down, and if I was 80 like my grandma, or 8 like my kid, it might kill, and maybe 1 in 100 odds someone would break a bone, but the fatality rate per accident would hover near enough zero.  In comparison, hit a pedestrian on a 45 (really more like 60) MPH country road and the only question is if they&#x27;ll be enough left to fill a coffin or not, so we&#x27;ll call that near 100% fatality rate per accident.  So the fixation on comparing fatality rates is meaningless.  There&#x27;s more to a good day than merely not dying in a bike-ped accident and I have no great desire to be hit over and over and &quot;its OK because I wasn&#x27;t killed and my desire to wear spandex is more important than your desire to live&quot;.  &quot;Well sorry I killed your kid or grandma but statistically they don&#x27;t count.&quot;  That&#x27;s not really a culture to aspire to.<p>Another example is the fixation on counts without discussing percentages.  Lets see, on my commute home about 60000 of my closest friends and I will drive on that major interstate over the course of the entire commute, while what, maybe a handful of bikers will spend hours taking the surface streets?  So if bikes were rabid death machines I&#x27;d still expect the death counts to be spectacularly higher for cars than bikers because practically no one bikes.  The death count from a rounding error will in fact approach zero.  That doesn&#x27;t mean Russian Roulette is a great game to recommend and the authors observation is meaningless.<p>I have mixed feelings in that my opinions and biases generally match the authors, because I like to ride my bike (although I ride safely, which even I admit is unusual for bikers), but I can&#x27;t decide if I should complain about the evils of propaganda or compliment the guy on doing a near legendarily good job at generating propaganda.

[1] I had thought you were talking about something different: whether offenses are to be charged concurrently or consecutively. It is my strong suspicion that the 3D1.2 grouping rules are also only a recommendation (there is certainly no doubt that, generally speaking, the guidelines are not legally binding -- a district court need only consider them and the sentencing factors they articulate), but I have not found a definitive answer yet.<p>But this distinction -- discretion to disregard 3D1.2 v. discretion to disregard 5G1.2 [2] -- is largely academic. Section 3 of the guidelines deals with determination of the &quot;total punishment.&quot; Section 5 deals with how to actually implement that punishment -- that is, how to use the traditional &quot;one sentence per count&quot; approach to implement the guidelines&#x27; &quot;total punishment&quot; approach. When there are multiple counts&#x2F;offenses of conviction, the district court groups the offenses, and determines a total punishment for each group (that&#x27;s 3D1.2). Then it implements that sentence by imposing it for each count (note: not &quot;group&quot;) of conviction, to run concurrently. (5G1.2) But, under Quinones (in the First Circuit) it appears clear that a district court, after adequate explanation, may depart from the 5G1.2 methodology and impose the &quot;total punishments&quot; consecutively instead of concurrently. So, even if grouping under 3D1.2 remains mandatory (which I doubt), it would seem that the court would still be free to depart from the implementation methodology provided in 5G1.2 to impose that &quot;total punishment&quot; more than once, consecutively. Here that means that even if the district court grouped all five counts together and arrived at a total punishment of seven years, under 3D1.2, it could still impose that sentence five times, consecutively, under 5G1.2.<p>It&#x27;s worth emphasizing that it would be quite unusual for a judge to do this, and she would have to quite clearly articulate her reasons for doing so in order for the sentence to not be vacated on appeal. This, I suspect, is why Popehat, for example, describes the operation of the guidelines as though it were mandatory -- typically an attorney can take for granted the fact that a judge will follow them or, at any rate, not depart too wildly. If you are trying to make a realistic prediction&#x2F;determination of a defendant&#x27;s sentence, the guidelines are where you look. But it also remains true that a district court may, with adequate justification, disregard the guidelines and have the sentence affirmed on appeal -- this includes the possibility here, however remote, of five statutory maximum sentences all to run consecutively.<p>[1] - <a href=\\\"http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2011/2011-3d12\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ussc.gov&#x2F;guidelines-manual&#x2F;2011&#x2F;2011-3d12</a><p>[2] - <a href=\\\"http://www.ussc.gov/guidelines-manual/2011/2011-5g12\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ussc.gov&#x2F;guidelines-manual&#x2F;2011&#x2F;2011-5g12</a>\",\"time\":1404760757,\"type\":\"comment\"}","{\"by\":\"afterburner\",\"id\":8000755,\"parent\":8000402,\"text\":\"Again, you&#x27;re applying rules too strictly.

I ran the math based on some trig and the speeds involved and at this blind corner both the biker and bus driver thought the intersection was clear until, at most, the last 1&#x2F;20th of a second of the kids life.  The passenger side wheels went right over the kids head, likely he never knew what hit him.

According to the PDF he linked to [1], 30% of American motorist fatalities are &quot;speeding related.&quot; This is not the same thing as &quot;caused by speeding.&quot; According to the NHTSA, speeding in this context is defined as<p><i>&quot;Speeding is reported in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) as a driver-level attribute that combines &#x27;driving too fast for conditions&#x27; or &#x27;in excess of posted speed limit.&#x27;&quot;</i> [2]<p>Note that, in multi-vechicle accidents, only one party needs to have been speeding for the accident to be considered &quot;speeding related&quot;. The 30% figure quoted also seems to vary quite a bit depending on the data you look at:<p><i>&quot;The percentage of all crashes that were speeding-related (DTFFC or EPSL) varied considerably among the States, from about 6 percent to about 20 percent of all crashes&quot;</i> (ibid)<p>The NHTSA distinguishes between two types of speeding:<p>1) Exceeding Posted Speed Limit (EPSL)<p>2) Driving Too Fast For Conditions (DTFFC)<p>The former simply occurs whenever one&#x27;s speed is greater than the posted maximum. The latter is a subjective call by the police officer, etc investigating the case and factors in road, traffic, and weather conditions.<p>The NHTSA has found (ibid) that about half of speeding-related fatal crashes occur for EPSL (55%) and the other half for DTFFC (45%). For speeding-related crashes that result in injuries, the respective ratios are 26% and 74% (ibid). The same source mentions that<p><i>&quot;The relative proportion of crashes that occurred on the curved sections of the road was much higher in speeding-related (DTFFC or EPSL) crashes&quot;</i><p>which suggests that many of these accidents were actually caused by either some form of driver inattention or adverse weather affecting road conditions, and that speeding was a contributing factor in the accident (i.e. less ability to correct for an unexpected event) but not the sole cause. Since driver inattention is almost impossible to prove absent records of an untimely text message or tweet, it&#x27;s likely that the true causes of most of these accidents (most likely driver inattention or overly agressive driving) go unreported and are instead attributed to the only measurable data point that can be discerned: speeding.<p>[1] <a href=\\\"http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/812006.pdf\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;Pubs&#x2F;812006.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=\\\"http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811090.PDF\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov&#x2F;Pubs&#x2F;811090.PDF</a>\",\"time\":1404761434,\"type\":\"comment\"}","{\"by\":\"melvinmt\",\"id\":8000823,\"kids\":[8001663,8001053],\"parent\":8000619,\"text\":\"I don&#x27;t think autocomplete is supposed to work for fields that check typos?\",\"time\":1404761437,\"type\":\"comment\"}","{\"by\":\"thisjepisje\",\"id\":8000824,\"kids\":[8021771,8022032],\"parent\":7998382,\"text\":\"<i>Surely you&#x27;re joking, Mr. Feynman!</i><p>Not very technical, but there&#x27;s some interesting stuff in there, for example about working on the atomic bomb in WWII.\",\"time\":1404761443,\"type\":\"comment\"}","{\"by\":\"jacalata\",\"id\":8000825,\"parent\":8000514,\"text\":\"He obviously doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s normal.

This is all from my history and point of view so I&#x27;m sure a lot of people will disagree.<p>Cost:<p>The days when big companies developed tooling and platforms cfor developers where great IF you worked at a company that could afford to pay for them.  They were expensive. When I first started these suites were tens of thousands of dollars expensive, and later just thousands of dollars. Sure they did a lot of stuff, but man there was also A LOT of overhead in managing the suite.  For young people and very small companies these things were unaffordable, and frankly unmaintainable.  A lot of times you would here about companies who paid 10-20K for a suite only to not use it due to the training required for everyone,  the installation cost, and the need to change your development process to fit the platform&#x27;s model.   So anyone starting out as a developer or starting up as company would find the cheapest&#x2F;easiest options available.  And since there are far more small development teams than big companies there was far more demand and community support for free&#x2F;cheap systems that while not great could get the job done.   Linux was free, mysql was free,Php was free, Perl was free, Javascript was free, and there were communities that would support a new developer through getting these up and running (no 2500 training class required).  The reason the LAMP stack became so popular was because it was free, could be installed on cheap hardware, and every element had a community that would support it.<p>Cross Platform Support and Application Distribution:<p>With C++&#x2F;C you had to compile for every target machine. What a nightmare,  library flags, macros, ugh.  Testing had to have special labs so they could find bugs that would popup in one OS, but not another.  Then it had to be cloned on disks and shipped out.  \\nJava came around with write once run everywhere which was better (MS came out with CLI and .net). The problem with these was making sure your customers had the base platform installed (the JRE or .net).  B2B companies was a little easier because they had standardized equipment and IT departments that knew what to do, but if you were targeting B2C or small business then getting them to install the base software (again JRE&#x2F;.NEt) was a pain because they would more than likely mess it up or just not know what to do so it required manual intervention.  As soon as this got easier you wound up with the conflict of people having TOO much installed on their computer and just not wanting to install anything else unless they HAD to.\\nFast forward to now and we&#x27;ve got a built in client that adhere&#x27;s to common standards. If they want to use your app they bookmark it, and when they are sick of it they just delete the book mark. Sure there&#x27;s cross browser issues, but they are far easier to deal with than both having the customer install some platform and dealing with cross OS issues (plus you dealing with them doesn&#x27;t require the customer to do anything but hit the refresh button).<p>Developer Inequality:<p>I don&#x27;t know how you can say there&#x27;s a higher barrier to entry now than previous.  In the 90&#x27;s almost everyone you met who was a developer was a CS&#x2F;EE major or started on computers at the age of 12. The arcane level of knowledge required for using platform to build an application in the 90&#x27;s dwarfs what&#x27;s required now. I still remember struggling with bugs where you&#x27;d go hunting for &quot;the guy&quot; who new everything, and then you&#x27;d spend a couple of days trying to figure where the issue was only to find some undocumented outcome to a flag passed to a lib. To the developer who was working for XXXX who wrote the library it this was a completely obvious and logical result.\\nCompare that to now.  StackExchange. Free Video tutorials, Websites dedicated to teaching you.  I constantly meet graphic designers, marketers, accountants, etc. who decided to become developers. I know who guy who has built a decent business with no official development education at all.  He learned rails and shoved up to heroku. He learned javascript to improve the client side, and now he makes a decent living.<p>You can start from NOTHING and in a few weeks have a base product built and being used by an alpha customer. That never would have happened 20 years ago.

Without GC, it&#x27;s very hard to determine when all threads have stopped examining a given node so that it can be safely deallocated.<p>See the following discussions on the difficulty of implementing lock-free data structures in C++ (b&#x2F;c of lack of GC):<p>* <a href=\\\"http://www.drdobbs.com/lock-free-data-structures/184401865\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drdobbs.com&#x2F;lock-free-data-structures&#x2F;184401865</a><p>* <a href=\\\"https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/topic/295279\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.intel.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;forums&#x2F;topic&#x2F;295279</a><p>Without a GC, you&#x27;d need hazard pointers[1] or RCU[2], both are rife with issues, and are either not general enough or perform worse than a GC.<p>&gt; Surely it depends on the nature of the task you&#x27;re trying to solve, locks aren&#x27;t always the bottleneck<p>True.<p>&gt; and there&#x27;s not always concurrent solutions.<p>Right, but if your code isn&#x27;t concurrent&#x2F;parallel there&#x27;s a hard (and low) limit on how fast it can run.<p>[1]: <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_pointer\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hazard_pointer</a><p>[2]: <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-copy-update\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Read-copy-update</a>\",\"time\":1404764497,\"type\":\"comment\"}","{\"by\":\"mkal_tsr\",\"id\":8001153,\"parent\":8000584,\"text\":\"The moment they announced Condoleezza Rice I closed my Dropbox account and moved to SpiderOak (playing with OwnCloud now).<p>Not having full e2e encryption is an absolute deal-breaker for me.

You might see the coin, and know with near 100% certainty what it shows. Or you might have some machine which detects whether it is heads or tails, and this machine has a certain accuracy. When it signals heads, you might say it has a 95% plausibility to really be heads. And before you measured the state of the coin, you might say the plausibility is 50%, assuming the coin is fair. So the plausibility does change at time of observation (or when you get new information).<p>What about the time of the flip? Well, after the flip has occurred, this concrete instance is either 100% heads or 100% tails of course. If I repeat <i>this exact coin toss</i> (which I can&#x27;t do in reality), I will always get the same result. And the probability to have heads, when you have heads, is 100% (P(toss #1 is heads | toss #1 is heads) = 100%).<p>This statement is a bit silly, but I think it shows that the probability of a thrown, lying coin to be heads or tails is not a very interesting quantity. Our degree of belief, given certain facts, that it is heads or tails, is interesting. And the probability of the coin in general, determined by its geometry, is interesting. And especially interesting is how you get from one to the other, which is where Bayesian inference, hypothesis testing, and so on come in (The coin is known to be rigged with heads=99%. My flawed detector says it is tails. What should I believe is the state of the coin, or what should I bet on?).<p>Finally, I should note that you should take what I&#x27;ve said with a grain of salt. I&#x27;m at best an armchair statistician, although I do get to think about stuff like this a lot at work (as a physicist).\",\"time\":1404764731,\"type\":\"comment\"}","{\"by\":\"incision\",\"id\":8001179,\"parent\":8000595,\"text\":\"Personally, I perceive the &#x27;complexity as a status marker&#x27; less a technological or programmer culture problem and more as one of business and job culture.<p>You won&#x27;t find someone building needless complexity into something if the fundamental goal pushes the limits of their abilities.

The author is not saying that we need a tool that lets literally anyone be a developer (&quot;So easy even a manager can use it!&quot;), but rather that the current technology stack is so hacky that it gets in the way of progress, and demands levels of specialized knowledge that are tangential to the task of building web applications: that is, a higher-level set of development tools. Just as (to pick a high-level, desktop-oriented language at semi-random) C# is easier to work with than x86 assembly language, because it hides the messy details, I think the author would like a world where building a web application is as easy as building a desktop application: a world where issues like data serialization, browser-specific JavaScript hacks (and the hacky frameworks meant to solve them), incompatible databases, constant vigilance against easily preventable attacks (cross-site scripting, SQL injection, etc), and the necessity of juggling at least 3 different languages (JavaScript, HTML&#x2F;CSS, and whatever you have on the backend) do not occupy valuable developer brainspace.<p>The issue is that the current web technology stack was never meant for building applications. HTML was designed for static documents. JavaScript&#x27;s early development was mainly for making terrible mouseover-effects on links. XMLHttpRequest is a historical accident. So, yeah, it all works together, somehow, but it wasn&#x27;t designed to be used as it is today, and it shows. And it&#x27;s the developers who carry the burden of integrating these hacks. I, like the author of this article, wonder if it wouldn&#x27;t be nice to design a system to provide the advantages of the web (distributed client-server applications with highly-customizable, visually attractive front-ends delivered on-demand) with a slightly more human development process. If we can&#x27;t replace the web outright, maybe we can build better tools ontop of it.<p>I agree that current web technology is a horrible pile of kludges. Let&#x27;s try to build something better. Some attempts are already being made. Please check out the amazing Ur&#x2F;Web language [1] that lets you write front-end code, back-end code (compiled to native), and database code in a single, type-safe language that statically guards against errors that are rife in dynamically-typed web scripting languages. It abstracts the database, without wrapping your data in an annoying object layer; it lets you write front-end and back-end code in one language that communicate transparently. It is far from a finished product but it is an amazing glimpse and what could be with intelligent develop tools. There are some great examples on-line that show how easy it could be. Easy for a developer, of course, not for a layperson.<p>[1] <a href=\\\"http://www.impredicative.com/ur/\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.impredicative.com&#x2F;ur&#x2F;</a>\",\"time\":1404764857,\"type\":\"comment\"}","{\"by\":\"jwb119\",\"id\":8001193,\"parent\":8001086,\"text\":\"Happy to talk to you about this if you&#x27;d like.
