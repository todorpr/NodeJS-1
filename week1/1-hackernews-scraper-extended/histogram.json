Well, if it has a, b, and c qualities in x, y, and z amounts. However, a key part in training classifiers is having negative as well as positive examples. It seems that from reading *just* about successful startups, you could incorrectly infer a bunch of necessary qualities for successful startups, when in fact those are qualities of all startups, or those are just qualities of the sample taken, and focusing on them is bogus. Having no direct experience in the matter, I can't give good examples, but it seems like you could fall victim to a breakdancing chicken problem: (made up example) all the interviewed startups wrote software, so writing software is an important step towards having a successful startups. Well, no, but it just happened that the interviewer focused on software startups. If you had examples of failed startups, you'd see that there was just sampling bias to",

(The quality of the internal employee care is less good than it used to be, since back when I started there in 1998, but I could just be bitter after the I/S department layoffs! :-)\r\n\r\nAnyway, the whole customer service area is saturated in an ethic of serving the customer. It really is amazing. For example, there are no timers on the calls. Ever wonder why some CSR's are so brusk? Well, they're usually trying to beat the clock. If their average call time goes above some magic number (often as low as two or three minutes) then they get written up by their supervisor. No such problem at Lands' End.\r\n\r\nI had to smile that Joel linked to the OCS (The Online Customer Store where he orders his logo'd shirts). I was one of the lead developers on that project. :-)\r\n\r\nAs for what happens to the returned items? They're sold off in the company employee store for a few dollars. If the company makes stipulations about the use of their logo, then a patch is applied over it, before selling to the employees, to protect the customers brand. As I recall, most customers don't mind.",

My own experience has been very isolating-I work long hours in the basement of a lab, limiting of my personal growth-I've been in a kind of 'stasis' where I'm in this college environment but very clearly do not fit the mold of a college student, and professionally frustrating - not only do I not have the kind of control over my project which people claim as the holy grail of a Ph.D., there is no clear end in sight to what I am doing.

He converted HotOrNot from an S-corporation to a C-corporation.  You can certainly reinvest profits from an S-corporation into the business or pay out profits from a C-corporation as dividends, but the incentives go different ways.  S-corp earnings are taxed as ordinary income (none of the double-taxation of corporate profits) and S-corps can't give out different classes of shares, so there's an incentive to distribute the profits out to the shareholders.  C-corp earnings are taxed once at the corporate level and then once as dividend earnings, yet they can have multiple classes of shareholders.  The incentive is to build up the business and eventually seek an IPO, acquisition, or other liquidity event.\r\n\r\nIt almost looks like James is positioning HotOrNot to get big and get bought.",

We've had to enact a policy at our company- if you ask someone how their stay has been and they say &#34;well, it rained a few of the days,&#34; whatever you do, _don't_ say &#34;yah, sorry about that- too bad,&#34; even though that's the most natural thing in the world to say.

Only apologize for things that really are your fault.  &#34;Sorry, my fault&#34; are magical words only when they are true (both parts).

And without that, there's no hope getting into something as prestigious as the YCombinator.<p>I propose we make a simple site that allows hackers find one another, locally. A single hacker isn't going to make a Meetup group to find other hackers; that takes too much work. It should be more like Craigslist, but for this startup community. Sorted by city, people can exchange email addresses, screen names, and most importantly, ideas. <p>All it takes is two founders, and you never know what kind of matches people will find. <p>Granted, they should know that they can work together before taking on a  huge project, but I think that something of this sort will really help people discover one another and get their startups going.<p>I'm not suggesting we re-invent Craigslist, but there are enough people here to merit something like this.

I am not so sure I agree with that. It seems to me that starting a company requires dedication, technical smarts and technical vision. All that a good comment or submission tells you is that the submitter spends a lot of time surfing the web and is articulate. Unless you have solid reasons to believe that the two sets of qualities are strongly correlated, I am not so sure you should be even consider using this as a metric. Having worked in Silicon Valley for some time now, I can say that some of the smartest people around here have inadequate language (and by implication -- commenting) skills. Quality of people's resumes are likely to provide a stronger indicator.",

There is obviously the group of hackers at CSAIL (Sussman et al.) that swear by LISP and the functional paradigms in general, but almost every class that involves a large amount of programming is in Java. Even 6.001 is being phased out for courses taught in Python.<p>As a current undergrad at MIT, I find myself sometimes struggling to determine whether I agree with Kevin or not. It does seem that my greatest selling point is my knowledge and experience with specific programming languages like Java and not any background I have in algorithms, discrete mathematics, etc. I feel that these other tools will prove more useful over the long term, but it's sometimes hard to continue to feel that way when the need for a summer job forces one to put away the common lisp book to read javadocs.",

I have two great programmers, even though they are working for me...I treat them like co-founders, we discuss everything not just technical issues, business model and even their love-lives! I'm also getting assistance from my network, people I've worked in the past with and people I've looked up to during my professional career.  Each one of these guys have stepped up to mat and offered me guidance each step of the way.  Some mentors I talk almost on a daily basis...I treat these guys like board members/quasi-founders also because without their guidance and support I'm sure it would be much harder.  Startups are not built alone - they are built by teams...these teams are composed of people who may not be traditionally considered co-founders but I'd argue they are.  So I respectively disagree with YCombinator shying away from one person startups - they really need to consider the entire infrastructure.  (Sorry for the long post- Chandra)",

Additionally, I always have a hard time considering someone to be uncommitted to a startup if they are working a separate full time job to support their family.

It was only later that I started noticing how many others were bookmarking and even started using it as a search engine.  Flickr- same thing.  Youtube & myspace- still kind of the same- say I was the first user of youtube, I may still like it so that I can put my videos in one place and shoot off an email to my buddies to go have a look.  The point is the tool better be compelling without a community or you'll never be able to grow a community.  Even here the content coming from one poster is compelling (enough) even before a dozen users started commenting and posting, etc.  Focus on the tool.  I couldn't agree more.",

By the time you get a real good idea working you won't care if the whole world knows.  You know that as simple as the idea sounded, it's really thousands of hours of blood sweat dollars and tears.  You'll say- &#34;oh, you want to do it also?  go right ahead and try.&#34;",

Another cool metric is &#34;if your idea can be given away by telling someone&#34; then it doesn't have enough depth&#34; Most simple things are way more complicated when u do them - and thats in the thought of the implementation. <p>Just look at eBay - a platform for auctioning goods. The depth comes in generating a trust system (how?) then making it easy to list, and for people to send each other goods. Then each of these ideas can be fleshed out. So its not really one idea - its a whole bunch including design decisions, customer acquisition strategies, page element preferences, copy, bug fixing - a whole load. ",

A niche that is sufficiently small might not attract any funding at all! So there is a downside to being small that must remain in check if you wish to attract funding. Enjoy :)\n- Jawad Shuaib",

In my experience, one of the largest hurdles to user adoption is getting something useful from the site.  If a user is able to see the value of the service *before* putting something into it, they are more likely to understand the offering and accepting the reward for 5 minutes worth of forms.  There are so many services competing for users attention and everyone of them are fighting for their niche.

I personally disagree that community is not necessary.  But, I don't think delicious does either.  For one, delicious has benefited greatly from it's community following.  Yes, it is a tool, and I do use it - under the normal circumstance - as an individual using a tool he own privately.  However, community allows me utility and efficiency when I can search for quality links tagged by others, or simply click tags that make sense when I'm saving a favorite.  I think you shouldn't use the word ignore here, it seems out of context.  Rather, I read him to mean you should focus on building a valuable tool for users and let the community follow.

A social network can harness the combined computation of the average Joe and create a rudimentary form of artificial intelligence. Amazon has already accomplished it. Today, we depend on Amazon bots to tell us what we will like. This is a major paradigm shift from less than a decade ago when we bought books solely based on recommendations from humans rather than computers. Everything a user does on a social network says a little bit about them. What happens if all those bits get put into one big trove of data about the user and their tastes? Advertisers heaven.",

Rockefeller has any prominent person or company truly practiced the art of vertical integration. Microsoft, for instance, has been unsuccessfully playing catch up with Google. The whole &#34;Windows Live Mail&#34;, &#34;MSN Soapbox&#34;, &#34;Live Spaces&#34; are nothing but microsoft's ill attempt at taking Google's crown. Instead of entering another market, a company should vertically innovate in services it already provides.<p>I believe that a lot of startups try to be everything to everybody; and in the process, lose focus. Finding a niche and sticking to it regardless of growth is better than entering markets that do not complement the company's core business. - Jawad Shuaib",

            "text": "I think this advice is somewhat misguided.  I'm currently on my seventh start up. I started two previously myself with my own money, but my current employer is VC and angel backed.  (I am the chief scientist) Relying only on your own resources such as credit card debt or a second mortgage on your home can be a very risky proposition.<p>Not just because you might lose your investment, but because by using your own money you are creating a situation of immense pressure.  The risk of losing your home might lead one to make some bad decisions regarding the business.  You have o be very careful here.<p>My second self funded company eventually did take about $100,000 in angel money.  But we started with only $50,000 of the two founders own money and we operated the business for four years with no other investment.  We eventually sold it to a public software company for $2 million dollars.  This might seem like a pretty decent investment, but at the time (mid 90s) it failed to attract the buzz that seems to feed VC investments.<p>It also depends on how much capital you really need.  Typically entrepreneurs underestimate this, but of course it is also possible to fool yourself the other way.  You have to be very realistic about this to make the right decisions.  My current venture requires us to installhardware in our customers' facilities, so it is somewhat capital intensive.  Only someone who was very wealthy could self fund such an enterprise.<p>In the end VC money spends the same as any other money, so deciding where you get your funds should be a business decision similar to deciding who to hire or what product to develop.  You should interview your investors as they interview you.  But few entrepreneurs do this.  They act desperate, and this often becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.<p>On another note, in my experience, entrepreneurs shouldn't expect most VCs to deliver anything more than money.  Of course they all tell you about the benefits of their strategic connections and so on, but in my experience it is very rare that these bear fruit.  One exception would be a venture fund targeting the specific industry you are developing your product for.  These funds often do have real valuable connections to bring to bear and can help in ways that vanilla VCs can't.",

Many have requested GANTT charts be added to basecamp, but jason et al. don't use them in their pm process so they refuse to ever add them no matter how many people request them.  I know several companies that have been unable to use it due to this lack of a feature.  It's not that we like GANTT charts, but there is a BIG difference in project management between a small design shop (ie 37 signals, most yc type companies, etc.) and a large regulated proprietary engineering company (like my current employer).",

            "text": "I think this advice is somewhat misguided.  I'm currently on my seventh start up. I started two previously myself with my own money, but my current employer is VC and angel backed.  (I am the chief scientist) Relying only on your own resources such as credit card debt or a second mortgage on your home can be a very risky proposition.<p>Not just because you might lose your investment, but because by using your own money you are creating a situation of immense pressure.  The risk of losing your home might lead one to make some bad decisions regarding the business.  You have o be very careful here.<p>My second self funded company eventually did take about $100,000 in angel money.  But we started with only $50,000 of the two founders own money and we operated the business for four years with no other investment.  We eventually sold it to a public software company for $2 million dollars.  This might seem like a pretty decent investment, but at the time (mid 90s) it failed to attract the buzz that seems to feed VC investments.<p>It also depends on how much capital you really need.  Typically entrepreneurs underestimate this, but of course it is also possible to fool yourself the other way.  You have to be very realistic about this to make the right decisions.  My current venture requires us to installhardware in our customers' facilities, so it is somewhat capital intensive.  Only someone who was very wealthy could self fund such an enterprise.<p>In the end VC money spends the same as any other money, so deciding where you get your funds should be a business decision similar to deciding who to hire or what product to develop.  You should interview your investors as they interview you.  But few entrepreneurs do this.  They act desperate, and this often becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.<p>On another note, in my experience, entrepreneurs shouldn't expect most VCs to deliver anything more than money.  Of course they all tell you about the benefits of their strategic connections and so on, but in my experience it is very rare that these bear fruit.  One exception would be a venture fund targeting the specific industry you are developing your product for.  These funds often do have real valuable connections to bring to bear and can help in ways that vanilla VCs can't.",

This is no mean feat - you have to be mentally prepared to grow and scale a company like mad and similarly your startup must have proved its case for being able to scale.<p>Whats the best way to know if your startup is ready? build a prototype, get some traction, look at the numbers, measure, experiment then measure again. If you truly are going to scale (and you are growing at 1% a day) and you've experimented enough that you've found a suitable path you'll end up needing money of the VC scale.<p>It doesn't cost much to sit around and build something. Go and test it - figure out what people want first - change your assumptions and above all PROVE that if you scaled your site it'd be worth it for investors. You don't need VC yet to start something and test it out - If it comes to that point well thats something to think about.<p>I'm reminded of the story Michael Birch of Bebo tells - they built something, put it out there off the traffic of birthday alarm and experimented with features. Every time a feature added to the growth of the site and got a noticeable increase in users they kept it and tried something else which also contributed to the growth. By experimenting, measuring and then iterating for things which correlated for growth they ended up on the right path. When they had 5 million users and were growing month on month they had the numbers to prove themselves. They took $15m from Benchmark capital. The bottom line - you'll know when you are ready: just go prove the numbers. ",

            "text": "Yeah, it's probably not so applicable to consumer facing internet companies since the approach really needs a business to buy into the idea (much more willing to preorder, a single sale could fund the entire development). <p>Although maybe that depends on what you are creating. I could see something like Hotmail or Skype being bootstrapped with this method, because those services are useful to both individuals and businesses. Back then, email from any PC with the internet or free international voice calls would have been things that many businesses would have paid for (and still would, if there weren't so many free alternatives now). Even Reddit got its NYT deal soon after starting which pushed it into the black, did it not? (not rhetorical - I don't know much about their history so tell me if I'm wrong!)<p>There is the problem of loss of focus though. If a company like Hotmail started in '95, realised it could make millions selling their product to companies and focused on that (sales, turnkey servers for easy installation), they would probably only get a few years of that income at most before they are dethroned by a company that just focused on making the best web based email possible. So it would be a bit of a local maxmimum. Is this more dangerous than the loss of focus of doing something totally unhelpful/unrelated to the main product to bring in some cash (contracting, searching for investors) while simultaneously working on the final product? I'd like to know what everyone thinks.",

It would be nice the be able to get feedback right at the beginning when I have only the the vaguest idea, and then to be guided by feedback as the project develops and matures. I would not be comfortable to share my pre-pre alpha project on reddit. And people would not be interested.<p>I believe that the search-space is too great that we should ever worry about other people stealing our precious idea. Starting from one point, different people would diverge and develop in different ways.<p>I don't know. But I would really welcome more openness. I think when an idea is interesting, and new, people would rather cooperate, and help along. Competition only happens (I hope) when people are chasing after the roughly same fad.\n",

Hes got just the thing.<p>Videos have multiplied on social networks like YouTube and MySpace as well as on news and entertainment sites because of the emergence of video-sharing, user-generated video, free digital storage and broadband and Wi-Fi networks.<p>Today, owing to the proliferation of large video files, video accounts for more than 60 percent of the traffic on the Internet, according to CacheLogic, a company in Cambridge, England, that sells media delivery systems to Internet service providers. I imagine that within two years it will be 98 percent, says Hui Zhang, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.<p>But search engines  like Google  that were developed during the first, text-based era of the Web do a poor job of searching through this rising sea of video. Thats because they dont search the videos themselves, but rather things associated with them, including the text of a Web page, the metadata that computers use to display or understand pages (like keywords or the semantic tags that describe different content), video-file suffixes (like .mpeg or .avi), or captions or subtitles.<p>None of these methods are very satisfactory. Many Internet videos have little or obscure text, and clips often have no or misleading metadata. Modern video players do not reveal video-file suffixes, and captions and subtitles imperfectly capture the spoken words in a video.<p>The difficulties of knowing which videos are where challenge the growth of Internet video. If there are going to be hundreds of millions of hours of video content online, Mr. Chandratillake said, we need to have an efficient, scalable way to search through it.<p>Mr. Chandratillakes history is unusual for Silicon Valley. He was born in Sri Lanka in 1977 and divided his childhood among England and various countries in South Asia where his father, a professor of nuclear chemistry, worked. Then he studied distributed processing at Kings College, Cambridge, before becoming the chief technology officer of Autonomy, a company that specializes in something called meaning-based computing. This background possibly suggested an original approach to search when he founded Blinkx in 2004.<p>Mr. Chandratillakes solution does not reject any existing video search methods, but supplements them by transcribing the words uttered in a video, and searching them. This is an achievement: effective speech recognition is a nontrivial problem, in the language of computer scientists.<p>Blinkxs speech-recognition technology employs neural networks and machine learning using hidden Markov models, a method of statistical analysis in which the hidden characteristics of a thing are guessed from what is known.<p>Mr. Chandratillake calls this method contextual search, and he says it works so well because the meanings of the sounds of speech are unclear when considered by themselves. Consider the phrase recognize speech,  he wrote in an e-mail message. Its phonemes (rek-un-nise-peach) are incredibly similar to those contained in the phrase wreck a nice beach. Our systems use our knowledge of which words typically appear in which contexts and everything we know about a given clip to improve our ability to guess what each phoneme actually means.<p>While neural networks and machine learning are not new, their application to video search is unique to Blinkx, and very clever.<p>How good is blinkx search? When you visit blinkx.com, the first thing you see is the video wall, 25 small, shimmering tiles, each displaying a popular video clip, indexed that hour. (The wall provides a powerful sense of the collective mind of our popular culture.)<p>To experiment, I typed in the phrase Chronic  WHAT  cles of Narnia, the shout-out in the Saturday Night Live digital short called Lazy Sunday, a rap parody of two New York slackers. I wanted a phrase that a Web surfer would know more readily than the real title of a video. I also knew that Lazy Sunday, for all its cultish fame, would be hard to find: NBC Universal had freely released the rap parody on the Internet after broadcasting it in December 2005, but last month the company insisted that YouTube pull it.<p>Nonetheless, Blinkx found eight instances of Lazy Sunday when I tried it last week. By contrast, Google Video found none. Typing Lazy Sunday into the keyword search box on Googles home page produced hundreds of results  but many were commentaries about the video, and many had nothing to do with Saturday Night Live.<p>Blinkx, which has raised more than $12.5 million from angel investors, earns money by licensing its technology to other sites. Although Blinkx has more than 80 such partners, including Microsoft, Playboy, Reuters and MTV, it rarely discloses the terms of its deals. Mr. Chandratillake said some licensees pay Blilnkx directly while others share revenue and some do both. Blinkx has revealed the details of one deal: ITN, a British news broadcaster, will share the revenue generated by advertising inserted in its videos.<p>For all of Blinkxs level coolness, there are at least three obvious obstacles to the companys success.<p>First, because Google Video is not much good now doesnt mean it wont get better: after all, when Blinkx was founded, it first applied machine learning to searching the desktops of personal computers, a project that was abandoned when Google and Microsoft released their own desktop search bars.<p>Second, even if Google improbably fails to develop effective video search, the field will still be crowded: TruVeo, Flurl, ClipBlast and other start-ups are all at work on different subsets of the market.<p>Finally, Blinkx might not go far enough in searching the content of videos: the company searches their sounds, but not their images.<p>THIS last objection is the most serious.<p>Because Blinkx emphasizes speech recognition, there is a great amount of multimedia content that they cannot address, like photographs, said John R. Smith, a senior manager in the intelligent information management department of I.B.M.s T. J. Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, N.Y. But whats worse, speech is not a very good indicator of whats being shown in a video.<p>Mr. Smith says he has been working on an experimental video search engine called Marvel, which also uses machine learning but organizes visual information as well as speech.<p>Still, at least for now, Blinkx leads video search: it searches more than seven million hours of video and is the largest repository of digital video on the Web.<p>Search is our navigation, our interface to the Internet, said John Battelle, chief of Federated Media Publishing and author of The Search, an account of the rise of Google. With Blinkx, we may have such an interface for digital video, and be a little closer to Mr. Chandratillakes vision of a universal remote control.<p>Jason Pontin is the editor in chief and publisher of Technology Review, a magazine and Web site owned by M.I.T.

Rupert Murdoch feels that online widgets are a zero-sum game; in other words, widget companies make profit at the expense of MySpace. This couldn&#39;t be further from the truth; the fact is that widgets complement MySpace by giving its users the choice to decorate their pages anyway they want. By restricting access to these widgets, MySpace will not only frustrate the users but also generate unprecedented negative publicity. - Jawad Shuaib",

Scaling is certainly a critical issue for these big sites; one of the reasons that Friendster waned in popularity was that they used algorithms and a back-end infrastructure that were painfully slow for their once-massive user base.  <p>On the other hand, a site should be able to handle several hundred thousand users with a single beefy database server, remote static file hosting, and a few load-balance webservers.  When you start &#39;scaling out&#39; to a bigger array of cheap hardware, you introduce complications that make your site harder to maintain and improve.  That change will need to happen at some point along the growth curve, but it seems to me that seed stage entrepreneurs need to be most concerned about making a product that people want to use.",

If you ever have to enforce an NDA, trying to argue that the entire conversation was confidential is much harder than simply producing the list of disclosures.\nAlso, I&#39;ve never asked an investor to sign an NDA.  Asking someone to sign an NDA indicates a lack of trust.  IMO if you don&#39;t trust the people you are talking to you probably shouldn&#39;t be talking to them at all.<p>Recently I&#39;ve been asked to sign NDAs as part of employment interviews.  This seems to have almost become standard practice now. I don&#39;t really think this is a great idea, and I often won&#39;t take an interview that requires an NDA.  But sometimes if I am certain that I won&#39;t be developing my own ideas in the field I&#39;ll sign one. Inevitably I find that these employment related NDAs are the most frivolous, silly, and irrelevant ones I sign.  YMMV.\n",

As I&#39;m sure you can imagine, there have been improvements in the field since then.  To be completely honest, I don&#39;t stay on top of search applied to speech, but the keyword you want is &#34;Spoken Document Retrieval&#34; (SDR).  Ciprian Chelba and TJ Hazen do cool stuff in this area; they are giving a tutorial at ICASSP this year SDR.<p>An aside.  Both of these approaches use the fact that when you process speech, you essentially form a graph of words (or phonemes).  Paths through the graph represent possible transcriptions.  So, since graph is a denser, richer thing to search than the transcript, and we&#39;ve got graph algorithms sitting around, there are neat tricks you can do to build a search engine index for speech...  <p>I&#39;ve recently been reading some interesting work that uses locality-sensitive hashing to search audio.  The Google speech people are presenting a lot of it at ICASSP this year.   See this post for more, and chase the links in their papers for even more:  &#60;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2007/02/hear-here-sample-of-audio-processing.html&#62;",

College-aged kids are probably the most valuable demographic to marketers in general (not because college kids have the most money, but because marketers like marketing to them because it makes them feel young), and college-age kids who actually go to college are even more valuable because they have more money on average.",

I would imagine the bigger problem here, however, is context switching.  Because Apache (and most other servers) use OS threading or forking, the entire state of the current process (let&#39;s say) has to be put aside and then restored later, maybe after only a few milliseconds- because the OS isn&#39;t going to presume anything about the state of that process.  In Erlang&#39;s concurrency model it simply runs 20 (or so, I think- anyway some static number) functions and then goes to another process.<p>Because the functions are, uh, functional there is almost no state to save and restore when there is a context switch.  Also because things like iteration are done with recursion- the 20 functions and then context switch doesn&#39;t get hung up on some loop somewhere.  The faster the OS tries to keep switching between processes, the more overhead it introduces.<p>BTW, this is why in my opinion you don&#39;t see a lot of other systems duplicating this sort of concurrency model- because there are some language &#34;limitations&#34; (recursion only, for example) that make it possible.<p>Most apache, erlang, or kernel hackers would know way more about this than I do, of course.",

The &#34;exception&#34; of Excite thrown in with 6 founders, IMO makes the author&#39;s intentions (conscious or unconscious) clear since one would expect some argument about whether Excite was really a success in the end.<p>Then there is the question of what constitutes a founder.  This isn&#39;t always so easy to define.  How many people founded IBM?<p>Despite Thomas Watson being listed as the &#34;founder&#34; of IBM, it is hard to even answer this question since IBM was formed out of the merger of three companies before it was even called IBM. (http://www.answers.com/topic/history-of-ibm)<p>Several responders pointed out correctly that the number of potential  communications channels rises as the number of founders increases.  And while that&#39;s clearly true, it is also true that more founders means more mouths to feed early in the company&#39;s development.  And to run any business you need to learn to manage communication amongst your team.<p>Finally, one has to be careful not to confuse correlation with causation.  Just because Microsoft was founded by two people, doesn&#39;t mean that was the primary reason for their success.  It might also have had something to do with who the two people were after all. ;)",

But at the same time studies show that there is a dramatic decline in the number of students graduating with computer science degrees.<p>The United States provides 65,000 temporary H-1B visas each year to make up this shortfall -- not nearly enough to fill open technical positions.&#34;<p>---<p>As a student of computer science / engineering, I can attest to the fact that the numbers are indeed dwindling. This past academic year, the department let go a large number of CS lecturers. In light of topics such as &#39;outsourcing&#39; and &#39;tech crash&#39;, there are many who are hesitant to pursue a career in software and technology. <p>I think the need has never been higher. Software Engineering recently topped CNN Money&#39;s list of growing careers. However it does seem that those are still involved in this industry are more passionate than ever and I see that everyday.",

In my experience, tech-savvy instructors rarely look for a generic CMS solution. And those without much tech experience resist change unless it is forced upon them because they are already good at what they do and change disrupts their ability to get their jobs done. Blackboard gets around this inertia by selling to university and school administrations, which then push the technology out throughout campuses. It is a top-down sales regime. The company has non-compete clauses so that instructors cannot adopt other systems even if they wanted to. Competing with Blackboard on their own terms would mean wining and dining a lot of administrators who are not going to be interested in beta-testing software.<p>The second problem is more fundamental. A lot of the really interesting stuff happening in the education field is happening with interest based communities like Chinesepod or even open source software projects (for an education in programming...). There are two things that are common to both sorts of communities: #1 they are interest driven, #2 the materials produced are not attempts to solve specific institutional needs so much as address individual &#34;learner&#34; problems. <p>A project like this should be very clear about whether it is serving institutional or learner needs. If you don&#39;t know exactly how to help students, what is the point of creating a system simply to automate stuff?",

However, universities generally do the job of teaching very well.  You also don&#39;t hear of fatal university shootings often (If ever?  I haven&#39;t looked.)  I&#39;m in it to improve the lives and education of high school students.  If I manage to better just one student&#39;s life, then I&#39;ll consider it mission accomplished.<p>High schools are very much open game.  They&#39;re open game because they can&#39;t typically afford the huge sums of money that universities can.  I plan to dominate the low end by creating a product that&#39;s simple, efficient, and inexpensive; something that every teacher would want.  I&#39;m not competing with Blackboard.  I&#39;m sidestepping them.<p>I agree that teachers have methods that they&#39;ve employed for years to teach students.  But part of that is exactly the problem.  When something is done exactly the same for years on end, it gets stale.  A teacher would have -fun- with my product, exploring other&#39;s ideas and communities.  I plan to make them happy.<p>They may be reluctant to use my product, but I plan to be with my two cofounders, on foot, visiting local high schools as soon as I have a feature set that&#39;s useful, and spending time with individual teachers to show them how they might benefit from it.  Then it&#39;s up to the teachers whether or not they&#39;ll use Classbug, but if I&#39;ve done my job well, they&#39;ll most certainly want to.<p>Shawn",

Which means that even if not more computing power is required you will be required to pay for another instance if you need more than 160GB. If we suppose you run one balancer, and two instance for database for replication, you need to pay at least 3 instances. \nWhich is $72x3=$216/month=$2512/year.  For the traffic of 1.5mbit/s which is 474GB, means you need at least $94/month=$1128/year. \nSo, for me I don&#39;t see really the advantage. If we suppose that with $2000 you buy a pc with 1TB and two dual core&#39;s at 1.8Ghz.\nSo, 512+1128=$1640/year for the bandwidth. You can lease a dedicated T1 line (1.5mbits x 1.5bmits) for $5200/year. \nSo, there is not really advantage going to Amazon.

If we add real means to block ads (mozilla add ons for example) to this subconcious rejection of advertising one can see that, in at most a generation, the viability of ad based businesses will be tenuous at best.  <p>Take the example of the Sprint ad which featured 3 guys dancing in the office.

The social product would not have worked as effectively upon launch without it being pre-populated by profiles.&#34; - Network effects are tricky to get started.

Dexter appears to be lifting his foot straight up off the ground and then falling forward to produce the forward motion. <p>The way humans walk is exactly the opposite. The toes are at a different angle from the foot (when walking), so that our feet effectively look something like ___/ , with the underscores being the foot and the / being the toes. We then transition from the ___ part of the foot to the / part of the foot and push forward, and land flat footed with the other foot. For whatever speed you are going, there is a proper ratio between landing on the ___ part of the foot and pushing off the / part of the foot, and that&#39;s where balance comes from. That is, the faster the acceleration of the fall, the faster you transition from ___ to / .<p>So in humans, balance comes from the way one step connects to the next step, whereas Dexter appears to be treating each step as a discrete unit, where it has to attain balance at the end of one step before going on to the next step.<p>If you actually have to balance yourself after each individual step instead of using the next step for balance, the problem seems in some ways to be much harder. <p>Also, the balance problem is greatly compounded by the small steps Dexter takes. Compare this to doing lunges. When you do a lunge, you basically take a long stride forward and then sink into it, all while keeping your torso perfectly upright. This gives you a much bigger platform for stability. As terrain gets steeper, the way humans walk becomes more like a lunge for this reason. <p>So my guess is that taking one tiny step and then balancing is the hardest part of this problem, because you have the least tools at your disposal. For example, you can&#39;t use the next step to balance you. However, once you can do the last step of the sequence, all the preceding steps working backward from the last one get progressively easier.<p>I don&#39;t know anything about robotics, but as an athlete and sports physiology geek I find the problem interesting.

And so it is hard for anything novel to get much traffic. One possible solution is to try to extend the attention span of the average web surfer much as you would with young children. Namely, present an idea in a cute and funny way.  See for example: http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/research/recording_head/pr/PerpendicularAnimation.html .  By extending their attention span in this way, you might be able to get them to understand and appreciate your novel service.",

People learning English would benefit by getting back feedback about how well their errors and corrections correlate with those from others.

There are a lot of non-dynamically balanced robots that would just blow the minds of researchers from 20 years ago, but they are still limited.<p>By solving the dynamic balance problem, even though to the untrained eye it may currently look less impressive than some other systems, there&#39;s no more ceiling to what it can do, dynamically (control-wise, not accounting for power density).

The first is hosts. What is the comparison between hosts? The second is how mature the language is. If I want to use python and I need a particular module that does 'fo '. it is probably out there somewhere (though it may be alpha or beta it will most likely out of date) unless you want to re-invent the wheel.  I can't say the same for Rails. Ruby is just a younger language with less code mass.<p>QUESTIONS TO ASK: In the end what really matters is how good the idea & business is. There are plenty of Rail based companies I can think of making a go of it. The same applies to Python based companies. If you accept that technology is an amplifier of ideas, will using Rails or Django alone make a better choice? Is the difference between them compelling enough to make a difference?  One area that could tip in Rails favour is \"susinctness\". But Django with it's python code base has more tools to choose from. \n",

The key thing to realize is that any particular feature that your language has doesn't necessarily matter.  For example, Python may happend to have a built-in way of doing<p>(with-input-file (in \"myfile.txt\")\n  (do-something in))<p>In Python, this might look like<p>withInputFile in \"myfile.txt\":\n doSomething(in)<p>(hey, I told you I was rusty on my Python...especially my totally made up Python!)<p>So maybe the feature came built-in to Python, in which case you're lucky--Guido happened to decide to implement this feature.  But what if he hadn't?  Well, just write your own abstraction.  Obviously, Python can open files and do stuff with the file's contents.  So it seems logical that you should be able to create an abstraction which saves you from writing the same boilerplate that you do every time you open an input file.  Unfortunately, there are some abstractions that *you just can't write* in most languages (including Python).  This file open example is a good one.  Here's another example, in the form of a programming challenge:<p>In Python, create an abstraction called \"debugExpr\" that consumes an expression E, and then does two things:\n  1) prints \"Expression E = V\", where E is the given expression, and V is the value E evaluates to.\n  2) returns the value V.<p>For example,<p>%python% 6 * debugExpr(2+3)<p>Expression 2+3 = 5<p>30<p>I'm betting you can't implement debugExpr in Python.  So assuming Guido didn't extend the language to implement this feature, you're pretty much SOL.  It's a shame because debugExpr, I think, is pretty darn useful.  It means that you can take any expression in your code and \"inspect it\", without worrying about adjusting the structure of your program, and without affecting its semantics.  Without debugExpr, I'd have to change my example code to be something like this to get the same result:<p>print \"Expression 2+3 =\"<p>tmp = 2+3<p>print tmp<p>6 * tmp<p>\nYUCK!\n",

I think this article was to help state and civic governments feel good about themselves.  Even the indicators like Venture Funding available and IT force don't mean much in the context of startups, in my opinion.  Not if the IT force are all government workers (like in Virginia) or the VC firm has a small portfolio of enormous brick-and-mortar businesses (dunno if that's true in one of those).<p>Possibly insightful initial data.

What strikes me as one of the biggest factors is that this seems unlikely to draw in too much external talent. The pool of people likely to start successful startups don't want to work for Yahoo until they're getting paid a lot to do so.

Instead, you're encouraged to contribute to the bottom line of Google, which severely limits the kind of things you can work on (i.e., \"do search or you're wasting your time\"). This is compounded by the fact that your 20% time is inconsistently factored into your employee evaluation (for better or for worse).",

User Interface Libraries, Yahoo! Pipes) . . . but at such a massive company, that code is coming from a very small percentage of its employees, and features such as '360' seem very uninspired IMHO. <p>At the end of the day, there is a disturbing theme throughout this article: give some of our best talent the opportunity to leave the mill and work on something revolutionary, and maybe they won't leave in the first place or keep their ideas secret, and just maybe they won't mind if the compensation is rather dismal compared to what it could be--after all, we can protect them from what so many of them consider the greatest risk: jobless with an unsuccessful startup.<p>Maybe they should ask themselves why they are a mill in the first place?

If I can ever be in a position which I can focus on my business full time without starving, then I'll do that.  That'll happen right around when I save up $15k, or the business is successful.
