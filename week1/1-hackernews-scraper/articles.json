We&#x27;ve gone through the research, we&#x27;ve met thousands of members in person and coordinated thousands of dates, and we&#x27;ve learned how to greatly improve the odds when it comes to personal introductions.

They were such a horrifying GPIO interface, and yet their presence meant that every open project used them by default, and if they didn&#x27;t then they used high priced tools instead.  Now that parallel ports are dead, we have an abundance of affordable USB GPIO devices to choose from, from Arduinos to FTDI devices (and many others of course).  And best of all, numerous devices can be connected at once via a cheap USB hub, unlike parallel port devices.",

It may synchronize with multiple sources: WebSocket to the server, WebStorage to the cache, WebRTC to a peer -- all at the same time.\nThat flexibility is paid by (1) implementing Lamport timestamps and by (2) limited use of version vectors (on handshake). ShareJS versions are linear, for example, but those linear versions are specific to a replica, as far as I can tell. In OT, version 3 here and version 3 there are possibly different.\nCRDT&#x2F;CT is generally easier to reason about than OT, esp. considering various non-standards situations and implications. That is mostly because CRDT (this flavor) employs &quot;partially ordered log of immutable operations&quot; while OT operations are mutable. That is the formal difference.",

        "text": "It would definitely be interesting to do that! I had originally started out wanting to do something as natural as possible, but got myself into all sorts of frustrating trouble with ants getting turned around or wandering off forever. I&#x27;m fairly sure these were just failures in implementation, but they forced me towards looking at slightly more artificial designs.<p>The Ruby-based simulator discussed in this article used Rich Hickey&#x27;s Clojure ant simulator as a starting point:\n<a href=\"https://gist.github.com/spacemanaki/1093917\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;spacemanaki&#x2F;1093917</a><p>This simulator was perhaps a bit closer to what you are looking for. It only emits one type of pheremone, which it releases on a continuous basis. However, it maintains a relative sense of position of where &quot;home&quot; is, which make it possible to prevent ants from &quot;flipping around&quot; within a pheromone trail.<p>In my simulation, I wanted to make it so the ants didn&#x27;t need to know where there home was, allowing them to rely purely following the gradient of the pheromone trails. To do this, I introduced two types of pheremones: one emitted when food was found, and another emitted when the home was found.<p>In retrospect, I possibly could have continuously emitted the &quot;food&quot; pheremone when traveling outbound, and the &quot;home&quot; pheremone when traveling inbound. I can&#x27;t remember if I tried that and ran into trouble, or just didn&#x27;t think of the idea at the time I was building this.<p>It&#x27;s worth pointing out that though the behavior of the world is very artificial (the whole trail gets marked at once after a complete path is run), the behavior of the ants themselves still only relies on their immediate location. And because these ants don&#x27;t know where &quot;home&quot; is, they&#x27;re even dumber than real ants that actually do have some sense of direction.<p>Anyway, refinements on this simulator or links to other simulations that illustrate these ideas are absolutely welcome! I&#x27;d definitely update the article if we found a way to improve upon what I&#x27;ve done.",

        "text": "Well, it&#x27;s good to have a hard-compiled language that&#x27;s (almost) memory safe. Three problems with Go:<p>- The Go mantra is &quot;share by communicating, not by sharing&quot;. Then look at all the thread examples in &quot;Effective Go&quot;.  They all share memory, while trying to construct locks using message passing.  Multi-threaded Go programs are not memory-safe. That&#x27;s why Google won&#x27;t let you use them on their AppEngine.  Compare Erlang, which takes message passing seriously.<p>- The lack of exceptions is resulting in hacks using the &quot;panic&quot; mechanism to create an exception mechanism.  This is where we were with &quot;longjmp&quot; in C.  I know someone at Google who has constructed a language on top of Go mostly to deal with exceptions.<p>- The lack of generics is resulting in hacks using the reflection mechanism to create generics. This is painful and slow. Go has generics for built-in objects; channels and maps are parameterized types, so there&#x27;s already syntax for instantiating a parameterized type.  Extending that to user-defined types would no be too bad. Fear of the C++ template mess seems to have been the problem.",

If you&#x27;re particular, that might mean only messaging one or two people per day depending on your style. What happens if you get that one match per week from Dating Ring and you automatically are not attracted to them based on appearance or personality? There are certainly people who seem really interesting and then they message me back and then it&#x27;s pretty clear that we&#x27;re never going to have a fun conversation, and you move on. Hard to do that with one match per week. I know online dating can be tedious at times, but let&#x27;s be honest, going to bars all the time or picking up a ton of new hobbies to meet new people is even more time-consuming and from what I&#x27;ve seen from myself and many other people definitely less fruitful.",

        "text": "Predicting who people will be attracted to is not actually that hard, and if you get a match and aren’t attracted, you tell us why and we’re able to improve future matches. Heck, some people email us pictures of their exes and we use that to send them better matches. You’re right that similarity &#x2F; interests &#x2F; and whether you’re attracted are all important. This is something that we can predict really well. A big part of this though is that people (especially women) are so inundated with ‘matches’ and messages on other sites that they never meet. OkCupid had a great recent blog post that showed that the power of suggestion is just as important as the matching algorithm. So what’s nice about our service is that people are much more likely to meet, since they only get 1 match and because of the matchmaker suggestion. This is not to say that it’s not worth using OkCupid or going to bars or picking up hobbies but I’d say to do them all. What’s $20 if it means a 1% higher chance of meeting your next partner? I know people hate putting a value on love, but the happiness I get from my partner is worth at least a million bucks (he cooks and cleans..). I was single for 3 years before meeting him, and if someone had told me there was a 1% chance of meeting him, that would be equal to $10,000. So even if you don’t agree with my math, $20 is still a far cry from 10k, and I would have paid a lot of money to have spent less time single. Of course, tons of people are fine being single or dating around, so it definitely depends on your priorities.",

        "text": "Given that there is already a completely free API for background checks provided by the federal government... wait, is it because that API is convoluted and patently insane?  So is sanity their real product?<p>Also, the way the federal background check system works, requests have to come from originating agencies that are set up to interface with the federal system.  Is Checkr going to interface directly, or are they going to do what most companies do and go through a state agency?  If going through a state agency - which one?  The fee that states charges varies RADICALLY... in some states, you pay basically what the federal govt charges ($14.25).  In others, they charge upwards of $300 per transaction to just submit your data and relay the answer.<p>Also, there is a new service called &#x27;Rap Back&#x27; which enables someone who runs a background check to sort of subscribe to a persons background... so if new items arise, like new arrests or the like, they can be notified.  Will Checkr support that?<p>I don&#x27;t really understand the link to &#x27;on-demand economy&#x27;... at least at the federal level, a background check will tell you nothing except whether the person has been convicted of a &#x27;serious crime&#x27; (the definition of serious crime varies widely from state to state... in Oregon almost all traffic violations are &#x27;serious&#x27;, while in other states nothing short of murder qualifies).  You don&#x27;t get to know when or what crime or anything like that, just &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.  Do you really want to avoid anyone who might have had a domestic violence issue in 1972 or a speeding ticket in Oregon 20 years ago?",

I&#x27;ve been a &quot;PC&quot; my whole life, and have somehow gotten away with never buying an Apple product, and never felt the lack.<p>However, many of the reasons I avoided Apple in the past are now irrelevant, as all but Linux now attempt the same fascist business model (The rings&#x2F;rules of Apple QA for software, and One store with which to rule them all).  My go-to argument against Apple in the past was:<p>&quot;In order to get an application or piece of software into the Apple ecosystem, you have to go through Apple.  Apple has a strict QA process, every app that gets into the store has to vetted by one of Apples legions of QA staff.  This sounds good; we want quality apps.  However, a great deal of Apple’s QA rules for acceptance aren’t just about app quality, but also nebulous ideas of morality and ethics.  The problem with that is, when only one agency is in control of what is proper and what isn’t, we are left with a situation where one agency gets to control what you see, use, and by environmental influence—think.  Now, imagine everyone exclusively owns an Apple product…”<p>Ironically, this notion is very 1984, and my stance on it was a bit extremish to be sure, but hey, I’m a PC.  Anyway, ever since Windows 8 and Windows Phone, it seems Microsoft has seen how completely Apple controls its own ecosystem, and wants a piece (complete with its own app ecosystem).  Suddenly Babylon had arrived on my desktop.  My initial thought was, “are we going to reach a situation where there are no more open platforms to develop for?  Are we going to get to a point where software can only be deployed through stores run by the same folks who run my OS? Do I have to learn Linux?!”<p>So, long ramble short, I’m thinking of joining the cult.  A few years back I was given an iPad as a present.  I initially resented it, labeling it a glorified TV-ala-Netflix device.  I have since spent hundreds on app purchases. \nIs now a good time to put on my robes and worship at the altar of Jobs?",

        "text": "Incidentally, what gets me the most about reading the experimental procedure is how they went about testing and how easily it would be to defraud such a system.<p>There are techniques for <i>exactly</i> measuring heat output of significantly more powerful generators without relying on simulations of designs of radiators and air flow. Consider that thermal solar plants produce megawatts of power during the day, several orders of magnitude beyond the E-Cat, and yet all of the technology around thermal solar generation measures to within 1-2% of reality, reliably. If they can be so precise on energy measurement at the scale of a utility, it is laughable that they would even try anything other than industry-standard techniques.<p>And color me an asshole, but I don&#x27;t buy that the &quot;high&quot; temperatures of 1500 degrees is a legitimate challenge to measurement, considering that other nuclear technology currently under development operates at millions of degrees and can be measure with much better guarantees of precision, despite also having to deal with deadly radiation and neutron emissions.<p>But no, instead of using fully trusted energy measurement procedures, which would work perfectly fine with a 2300 watt nominal heat generator at 1500 degrees (1.5MWh seems like a lot, but it&#x27;s only 2300 watts over 32 days, roughly the amount of energy it would take to run two decent microwaves for that period of time), they simulate and estimate based on temperature sensors and IR cameras.<p>And even ignoring their questionable measurement procedures, 2300 watts of fraud would be trivial to inject into a system like that with a handful of magnetrons and a waveguide... like how a microwave works.<p>If I, a computer scientist with a reasonably modest level of physics and chemistry education (from 14+ years ago) can think of several methods by which to trivially defraud observers (via measurement methodology, or by injecting external power remotely), and that their testing methodology seems purpose-designed to defraud, it makes me ask two simple questions:<p>1. If this is a fraud, in what world did they believe that this turd sandwich would actually be believed?\n2. If this is not a fraud, why wouldn&#x27;t they have used an industry standard measuring methodology instead of throwing all of this other measuring bullshit into their paper, citing the proprietary nature of the measurement devices, while simultaneously claiming precision.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I think it would be awesome if this were real. But if I wanted to make claims and defraud observers, I&#x27;m not sure I could design a better setup for fraud.",
